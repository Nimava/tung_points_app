This point works best when it is bled. Pinch the muscles first prior to bleeding. | Johnson: Bleeding technique: Bleed All Pivot with a large tipped bleeding needle, rather than a smaller diameter needle that would be used for deeper punctures. In this case, a lancet is entirely insufficient. A shallow bleed is always done with a large tip in order to make a bigger puncture site, allowing for a larger volume of blood. Patient positioning: Ask the patient to sit in a chair, with their elbows on the table and hands supporting their forehead (like a tripod). Make sure they do not drop their chin, as this would make the area in the back of the neck tighter, and therefore harder for you to grip. Pinching up the skin: The difficulty in bleeding All Pivot is that the skin must be pinched and firmly held. If you are within the hairline (as you will be on most patients), the hair will cause the skin to slip through your fingers when the pressure of the needle is applied. Because a superficial puncture will not do the job, it is necessary to pinch as much flesh as possible in order to secure the area and allow for a deeper puncture, as deep as 3-4mm. This point rarely bleeds on its own; it has to be “milked.” Squeeze and swipe: Once the point is punctured, squeeze hard and swipe, squeeze hard and swipe, and keep it bleeding for a few minutes. If the puncture closes and beads of blood dry up before you are done, gently scrub the puncture site with a wet cloth to open it again. Note: Use water rather than alcohol on the puncture site, because alcohol will sting unnecessarily. Blood vessels: On two occasions in more than thirty years, I have hit a blood vessel in this area, causing spontaneous bleeding. As long as the bleeding is not rhythmic, you will know that it is from a vein, not an artery. Should this happen, and the bleeding is not rhythmic, allow it to bleed for 60 seconds and then apply pressure to stop the bleeding. In this area, a point that bleeds on its own may be likely to open up again later, so be sure to advise the patient to wait until the following day to shower or wash their hair. Depth: 0.3.0 cun",

Though All Pivot may help with morning sickness, I never use it for this issue because it does not address the root of the problem, namely protein deficiency. See 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points for further information and dietary advice. Energetic pathways: When properly punctured, All Pivot is extraordinary in relieving extreme nausea and vomiting because it releases toxins that have accumulated in the area of the brain stem. In fact, nausea and/or vomiting is a sign of toxin buildup, often related to chemical exposure, drug addiction withdrawal, heat stroke or motion sickness. Additional energetic functions include: Clears Heart and calms spirit Clears heat and calms wind Clears the brain Expels wind Nourishes the Sea of Marrow Benefits the tongue and treats muteness Nausea: When a person is nauseous, their stomach spasms and draws upward. By bleeding this area of the brain stem where toxins collect, we cause the stomach to relax and descend. The patient usually experiences a sensation of the stomach dropping within the first minute after bleeding begins in this area. In the past 30 years, on two occasions I have punctured a vein here, but it is rare for this to happen. Aside from those two occasions, I have found it necessary to squeeze hard in order to draw one drop of blood. Sometimes it may be difficult to get the blood going, but once you do, you may keep it going by occasionally swiping the area with a damp cloth. Even in cases of paralytic colon with extreme dry heaving, the patient usually reports feeling the stomach drop within the first minute or approximately 10-20 drops of blood, and feeling relief from the nausea. Once the stomach drops, I continue to bleed the point for another minute or two in order to completely clean the toxins from the brainstem area. Gua Sha (Dr. Lee): “Bleeding this point can stop nausea and vomiting and tranquilizes the hollow bowels. One can also use Gua Sha to turn the skin in this area black and blue, instead of bleeding” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Note: Dr. Lee did this Gua Sha treatment on me. It is excellent for stiff neck and detoxifies the brain stem of accumulated pollutants, but for nausea and vomiting, Gua Sha is far slower and more painful than bleeding All Pivot. Paralytic colon: A patients whose colon does not “wake up” after anesthesia does not recover their bowel sounds, and therefore cannot be discharged from the hospital. Because toxins are being reabsorbed into the bloodstream through the colon, the patient quickly becomes very nauseous. Because the patient has not eaten since the night before their surgery, their vomiting is dry heaves. We bleed All Pivot to stop the nausea and vomiting, and to drop the stomach. Once the patient is comfortable (within five minutes of bleeding All Pivot), needle SP4 Gong Sun and PC6 Nei Guan to restore peristalsis. Within four to six hours, there should be bowel sounds. Note: I try to treat the patient early in the day so that I can return in the later afternoon, if necessary, to reapply the needle portion of the treatment. In thirty years, I have had to return to the hospital only two or three times. This treatment works like a charm, and in every instance, the patient has gone home the same day. Side effects from cancer treatment: Bleeding All Pivot is a real blessing in helping patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and radiation and suffering from nausea. I never hesitate to bleed All Pivot to drop the stomach, as this does not interfere with the cancer treatment. Since treating HIV in the mid-1980s in San Francisco, I have always recommended the use of THC to treat nausea and vomiting and also to encourage appetite. These days, I suggest using CBD instead, unless the patient needs the THC to make them hungry.1 When the patient takes a break in their chemotherapy program, thoroughly cup DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, so as not to interfere with the best effect of their chemotherapy. Heat stroke: For marathon runners or people who are suffering from heat exhaustion or summer heat stroke, bleeding All Pivot beautifully descends the reflux of Stomach qi. Be sure the patient hydrates slowly with warm water, as excessive water or cold water may cause reflux. Loss of voice: All Pivot treats lost voice from internal weakness, cold or flu because it is a wind point, and because it is opposite REN24 Cheng Jiang. Stroke: All Pivot treats sudden aphasia and difficulty swallowing. Motion sickness: Although All Pivot drops the stomach in cases of extreme motion sickness, Dr. Young gave us a good alternative for treating children. He said to tape a slice of raw ginger to PC6 Nei Guan and have them eat dried mango, a much better solution for kids.",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: 1010.08 Tranquility is located on the DU meridian, just above Yin Tang (Extra Point), and it has a very strong sedative effect.

Tranquility connects Lung and Heart to treat both, making this an excellent point to calm the Heart and spirit, and to open the mind. Other functions include: expelling wind, alleviating pain, activating the collaterals, and benefiting the nose and eyes. Calming the spirit: For my patients with anxiety, hyperactivity or Liver yang rising, this is the first needle they receive if they are lying face up. It helps them to stay on the table, relaxed or asleep, for the duration of their treatment. When they wake up, they feel rested and rejuvenated. Clear the brain: Combine Tranquility with 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20) for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia and manic depression to calm the spirit and clear the brain. Precautions: Tranquility descends the qi and clears the brain, so if the treatment is designed to raise the pure qi to the head, be sure it is in the patient’s best interest to add this point. Some patients with depression benefit from Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment with the addition of Tranquility and DU20 to clear the brain, though the rest of the treatment is directed toward bringing the pure qi to the head. If a patient has a frontal headache, I only needle this point if the headache is sinus related. ",

        "comments": "Migraines (Tai Yang area): Bleeding the veins in the temple area deemed Tai Yang (Extra Point) is immediately helpful, and has a profound and lasting effect on migraine headaches. This technique is included here because in my opinion, bleeding any vein found in the sphenoid and frontal bone areas usually works like a charm on stubborn headaches. (Be sure you bleed a vein, not an artery. Arteries have a pulse; please check for the pulse with your fingers before you put on gloves to bleed the point.) I have successfully bled the vein found over the eyebrow many times to treat chronic migraines, especially those related to excess blood stagnation in the head. On a few occasions, one bleeding treatment was all it took to eliminate stubborn migraines forever. Do not be shy about performing this technique when the results can be life changing for your patient. Bleeding this area expels wind, alleviates pain, and benefits the eyes. Case history (herpes in the eye): These points are bled to clear the head and eyes. I have had several patients with herpes in their eye. One patient was taking Acyclovir around the clock and was still having regular outbreaks. He complained of seeing “cotton balls” in his visual field (indicative of white blood cells in the area), constant irritation in the affected eye, and diminished visual acuity. After I bled a vein that extended into the area of 1010.10 above his eyebrow, the sclera changed color from intense red to mostly white, the irritation subsided and the “cotton balls” disappeared from his visual field. With the third bleeding of this vessel, the output of blood significantly diminished, signaling the healing or shrinking of the vessel itself. The patient discontinued Acyclovir and had no further outbreaks in the following ten months until the death of his father, at which time he had a massive herpes outbreak in the same eye. When I bled the vessel again, it produced 50% of the original output, and so instead I bled the Head and Eye points found on the sides of the tip of the middle finger (Koryo Hand Therapy-KHT), thus saving the vein above his eyebrow in case it would need treatment for another traumatic event in the future. Intestinal correspondence (Dr. Young): “1010.11 Four Bowels First and 1010.10 Four Bowels Second have a holographic correspondence to the Large Intestine and the Small Intestine, and are therefore indicated for abdominal distension” (Dr. Young, 2008).",

        "comments": "Migraines (Tai Yang area): Bleeding the veins in the temple area deemed Tai Yang (Extra Point) is immediately helpful, and has a profound and lasting effect on migraine headaches. This technique is included here because in my opinion, bleeding any vein found in the sphenoid and frontal bone areas usually works like a charm on stubborn headaches. (Be sure you bleed a vein, not an artery. Arteries have a pulse; please check for the pulse with your fingers before you put on gloves to bleed the point.) I have successfully bled the vein found over the eyebrow many times to treat chronic migraines, especially those related to excess blood stagnation in the head. On a few occasions, one bleeding treatment was all it took to eliminate stubborn migraines  forever. Do not be shy about performing this technique when the results can be life changing for your patient. Bleeding this area expels wind, alleviates pain, and benefits the eyes. Case history (herpes in the eye): These points are bled to clear the head and eyes. I have had several patients with herpes in their eye. One patient was taking Acyclovir around the clock and was still having regular outbreaks. He complained of seeing “cotton balls” in his visual field (indicative of white blood cells in the area), constant irritation in the affected eye, and diminished visual acuity. After I bled a vein that extended into the area of 1010.10 above his eyebrow, the sclera changed color from intense red to mostly white, the irritation subsided and the “cotton balls” disappeared from his visual field. With the third bleeding of this vessel, the output of blood significantly diminished, signaling the healing or shrinking of the vessel itself. The patient discontinued Acyclovir and had no further outbreaks in the following ten months until the death of his father, at which time he had a massive herpes outbreak in the same eye. When I bled the vessel again, it produced 50% of the original output, and so instead I bled the Head and Eye points found on the sides of the tip of the middle finger (Koryo Hand Therapy-KHT), thus saving the vein above his eyebrow in case it would need treatment for another traumatic event in the future.

I hope that you will never needle it that way again, as that location and insertion are extremely painful and virtually ineffective. 2 Fu Kuai translates as “Bowels Fast;” however, I always refer to this point as “1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20)” and only needle it as described in the needling notes. Curving needle technique: My preferred way of needling Welcome Fragrance is to utilize the laugh lines at the level of the nasal ala and direct the needle superficially toward Yin Tang. The difficulty of this manner of insertion is that a slight curve must be introduced to the tip of the needle in order to lift it over the edge of the nasal bone. I have developed an easy method that I call “the curving needle technique.” By holding the handle of the needle at a 45-degree angle away from the body, and thus flattening the shaft of the needle against the skin, introduce a curve in the shaft that extends to the tip and causes it to lift up and over the bone. Watch the tip of the needle as it is progressing, and after the tip of the needle passes the nasal bone, lower the handle to drop the curve. By doing this, you will avoid contact between the needle tip and the sensitive underside of the epidermis. Note: This curving needle technique is useful in the insertion of many different points (11.06 Return to the Nest, 22.04 Da Bai, 22.08 (SI3), 66.10 (SP3), 66.11 (SP4), UB65 Shu Gu), but in Welcome Fragrance it is essential, because a straight needle insertion will painfully hit the bone.

Digestive issues: Because LI20 Ying Xiang is the crossing point of the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians, in Tung’s acupuncture it also has the indications of abdominal distension and pain. Because there are so many other useful points for digestive conditions, I never use LI20 that way, though it may result in some positive side effects for digestion.",

Resolves pain; does not dissolve stones: Wood Branch resolves real gallbladder pain and early stage gallbladder inflammation, though it doesn’t dissolve the stones. I love using this point with 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points in the treatment of cholecystitis, sludge or stones in the gallbladder. My experience with Wood Branch is that it keeps the patient comfortable until the effects of 88.14-88.16 have time to work. Recently, I stopped using Wood Branch when the patient was no longer experiencing any gallbladder discomfort, and two days later the pain returned (though it was minimal). I recommend using Wood Branch for at least three treatments before continuing with 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points alone. See 88.15 Fire Branch/88.16 Fire All for a comprehensive discussion of gallbladder diseases. Gallstone commentary (Dr. Lee): “The presence of gallstones indicates that there is something is wrong in the patient’s life; they are unhappy, worried or full of regret” (Dr. Lee, 1992). “Empty gallbladder:” A patient with Liver weakness is easily tired. A patient with Gallbladder weakness is easily startled; this is called “empty gallbladder,” indicating that the bile is lacking.",

        "techniques": "Needle obliquely and away from the midline, 0.1 - 0.5 cun . It is not necessary to be exact on the point location. Look for an area near this point that is dark or purplish in color to needle for best results. | Johnson: Dao Ma: Water Through and Water Gold are usually needled together in the combination called 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/Water Through.3 Patient positioning: Asthmatic patients may need a higher pillow or two pillows in order to breathe more comfortably; always ask them what they would prefer. Bilaterally needled: The points are usually needled bilaterally by threading the needles horizontally toward the corner of the jaw. In cases of one-sided pathology, they can be needled on the side opposite the indications. Superficially threaded: To keep the needle superficial, first tap the tip in just beneath the epidermis, on top of the muscle. Then, flatten the shaft of the needle against the skin by holding the handle up slightly while advancing the needle toward the corner of the jaw. When the needle is superficial enough and in the proper zone, you will be 3 Though the point numbers are reversed, I always refer to this combination as “Water Gold/Water Through.” able to see the tip of the needle progressing. I needle these four points in this manner (using only one hand) in order to keep my hands away from the patient’s face and eyes. Alternately, while you are learning to do this efficiently, once the needle tip is inserted you may press your thumb against the needle shaft while advancing the needle. This has the same function of flattening the needle shaft, using the surface of the chin as a guide, which keeps your needle trajectory as superficial as possible. Bruising: These points may bruise easily, especially if the needle is inserted too deeply. The two more lateral points are more likely to bruise. Keep the needle tip superficial enough to see it moving back toward the angle of the jaw. This prevents bleeding or bruising caused by contact with the blood vessels located in the large, strong masseter muscles. Sensitivity: While you insert the needles, watch for the patient “hard blinking” their eyes; this provides feedback on their sensitivity. Often the points are very sensitive toward the end of the needle insertion, due to the number of nerves and blood vessels in that area. In some patients, the tip of the needle may touch the masseter muscle once it is fully inserted. This is a large muscle with lots of nerves and an ample blood supply, so it can be sensitive. In this case, when the needle is removed, there may be a drop of blood, and the point may bruise a little bit. Parallel appearance: When needled together, the needle handles will be parallel to each other after insertion. Handles crossing: Depending upon the size of the ball of the patient’s chin, the needle handles may cross when 1010.20 Water Gold is needled. Alternative needle technique: Dr. Young suggested to bilaterally thread a single needle from 1010.20 Water Gold toward 1010.19 Water Through in the direction of the Lung area on the cheek. Note: I tried this technique for about six months but found four needles to be more effective. Areas of influence: This area of the face relates to water. Needling toward the left side of the face influences metal. Needling toward the right side of the face influences earth. Needle retention: On occasion I have sent patients home with these needles retained, and asked them to return for removal in a few hours. This way, in the treatment of chronic cough or chronic lower back pain, the points have more time to work. If I am needling the points “to go,” the needles must be angled slightly downward (to counteract gravity and the weight of the needle handle) and inserted 1.0 cun, so as not to walk their way out. I also show the patient how to ease them back in, as they frequently start to come out when the patient talks too much. If a needle falls out completely, the patient is instructed to bring it back to me for disposal and not to reinsert. I may teach the patient to use just acupressure without needles as a self- treatment. Depth: 0.5-1.2 cun",
        "comments": "Water Gold/Water Through with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses: I cannot speak highly enough about this combination of points and find myself using it all day, every day, in my clinic. Water Gold/Water Through points treat Kidney and Lung, while 88.17-88.19 Four Horses points treat Lung and Liver. Used together, these point patterns are extraordinary for all lung diseases, especially asthma or bronchitis due to allergies. This is always my “go-to” combination for severe common cold, bronchitis, cough, pleurisy, or emphysema. Because Four Horses strongly tonifies the qi, and Water Gold/Water Through tonifies the Kidneys, this combination is very helpful when treating chronic lung diseases of the weak or elderly, including: pneumonia, COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and lung tumors. Sometimes I also add LU5, and almost always add A.04 San Cha Three. •  Energetic pathways: Due to their location on the chin, Water Gold and Water Through are easy to locate and needle, making them very clinically useful. They are chosen to treat conditions such as cough or asthma, and they are often combined with other points to refine or hone the direction of the treatment or improve a treatment outcome (see Combinations below). These marvelous points increase the power of the Kidney qi, which comes from the Kidney and Lung, and this is reflected in the point names. “Water” indicates a connection to the Kidney, while “Gold” indicates a connection to metal and the Lungs. Water Gold/Water Through points have the Reaction Area of Kidney and were two of Master Tung’s favorite points for tonifying and strengthening the Kidneys. •  Regulating qi and blood: The Large Intestine meridian is internally connected to the Lung and goes around the mouth, ending at LI20 to connect to the Stomach meridian, and tonifying the earth to produce metal. Because the Yang Ming (ST/LI) channel has more qi and more blood, Water Gold/Water Through points are effective in regulating qi and blood, strengthening the Lung and Kidneys. •  Diagnostic clues: A green hue around the mouth and chin is a sign of Kidney weakness and could indicate chronic Kidney deficiency in cases such as asthma and lower back pain. Additionally, darkness around the eyes, especially under the eyes and/or extending through the area of the lacrimal bone, indicates extreme depletion and might also occur with dizziness, blurred vision and lower back pain. In patients who have received a kidney transplant, I have noticed extreme discoloration in this area. •  Diagnostic signs of Kidney deficiency (Dr. Lee, 1992): •  Darkness under the eyes: “These points treat Kidney weakness and fatigue, In this case, the skin under the eyes will be dark and there will be dizziness, blurred vision, low back pain, etc.” •  Greenish hue under the chin: “According to Master Tung, if the Kidney weakness is severe, one will find a greenish or darkish vein under the chin. If one needles through this, it will bleed upon withdrawal of the needle. It may also cause this area to be black and blue for a few days. If the disease is not so severe, needling this point will not result in bleeding or bruising. If the skin is darkened in this location, needling here can effectively treat a variety of diseases.” •  Facial hue in asthma: “Patients with long-term asthma due to Kidney weakness also tend to have a green or gray facial complexion. Using these two points to treat this condition lightens the face color.” •  Little finger length: The little finger usually extends beyond the crease between the second and third phalanx of the ring finger. A short little finger indicates Kidney deficiency.Breathing (KD and LU): In Chinese medicine, breathing is viewed as the Kidney qi grasping the descending Lung qi and anchoring it. If the Kidneys are not able to receive the Lung qi, breathing is long and labored. If the Lung qi is not descending, there is panting. Water Gold/Water Through points connect metal (Lung) and water (Kidney) to strongly tonify the Kidney and powerfully regulate Lung qi. They are useful for symptoms of qi reversal, such as cough, asthma, hiccups and vomiting. •  Cough, asthma or bronchitis: 22.11 Earth Water is a three-point pattern and is Tung’s version of LU10. In TCM, LU10 Yu Ji is the Ying-Spring point of the Lung meridian; it clears Lung heat and sedates fire. 1010.19 Water Through has a similar function when combined with 1010.20 Water Gold. They are my favorite points for treating acute or chronic cough, asthma or bronchitis. Though acupuncture is very effective for calming asthma, in serious cases you must combine acupuncture with herbs. Cupping the upper back, including Ding Chuan (Extra Point located next to DU14), is always useful in treating early wind chill and often asthma, as well. •  Cough (Dr. Young): “1010.20 Water Gold calms the qi. For cough in the morning needle 1010.20 Water Gold with 22.11 Earth Water (Tung’s LU10). For cough in the afternoon needle Water Gold and 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5). A very simple treatment using just these two points” (Dr. Young, 2008). •  Transporting Points: In several of Dr. Young’s lectures, he provided the following examples of Transporting Points used for cough, with seasonal and time references: Seasonal uses: •  For cough in winter or at nighttime: Use Jing-Well points. Needle one point on each side with a thin piece of ginger inside the patient’s mouth, between the cheek and gum. •  For cough in spring or in the morning: Use Ying-Spring points. •  For cough in summer or at noon: Use Shu-Stream points. •  For cough in fall or afternoon: Use He-Sea points. Horary times:•  3:00–9:00 a.m. = morning: Use Ying-Spring points. •  9:00–3:00 p.m. = noon: Use Shu-Stream points. •  3:00–9:00 p.m. = afternoon: Use He–Sea points. •  9:00–3:00 a.m. = night: Use Jing–Well points. •  Low back pain (Active Qi Moving): I love the effects of Water Gold/Water Through in strengthening the lower back and legs, and have used them successfully many times over the years in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. Due to their location on the chin, these points allow the patient to gently walk around while the needles are retained (Active Qi Moving). I typically ask the patient to walk around the clinic. If this is not possible they may walk outside, though if they are elderly, I am reluctant to send them out of my sight.•  Acute lumbar sprain (Dr. Young): Needling opposite-side 1010.19 Water Through and 1010.13 Horse Gold Water offers immediate relief for acute lumbar sprain. Needle bilaterally if the condition affects both sides. The sooner you can needle these points after the onset of the condition, the more effective the treatment will be (Dr. Young, 2008).Note: For acute lumbar sprain, I also recommend the following treatments: 1.  Bleed veins found in the popliteal crease (UB39-UB40 area). 2.  Cup the lumbar/sacral area. 3.  Needle 11.12 Er Jiao Ming. •  Male sexual disorders: Water Through tonifies deficient Kidney qi, increasing energy (including sexual energy), and it is used to treat impotence, paralysis, and weakness in the legs. Kidney qi, derived from Kidney and Lung, is also a factor in prostate enlargement.•  Impotence and premature ejaculation: Needling 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/Water Through strongly tonifies the Kidney qi. However, the best point for impotence is LV1 Da Dun, the wood point on a wood channel, which opens orifices and drains dampness, and is a good point to relieve stress from nervousness. The Liver channel passes through and around the genitals, and LV1 Da Dun is a Jing-Well point that clears heat, frees the channels and calms the spirit. Premature ejaculation happens when the Kidney is hard to control; needle 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors to treat both impotence and premature ejaculation. •  Arthritis pain due to Kidney (Dr. Lee): “These points treat joint pain due to Kidney deficiency. In this case, the kidneys are not adequately removing uric acid, which then deposits in the joints as crystals. One can tell if arthritis is due to Kidney deficiency by blackness or darkness of the chin” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (acute back strain, Dr. Lee): “A physician came to my office at 6:00 am one day. That morning, while putting on his shoes, his back went into spasm. I needled these four points and had him walk around, twisting his back, lifting his legs, and trying to mobilize his back as much as possible. After the treatment, he returned home and took a short nap. At 10:00 am that same morning he went to his office and saw patients all day as usual. This doctor reported to me that when this had happened to him before, if he took very strong medicine for such back spasms, he had to stay in bed for three days and then would have side effects of headache and stomachache. If he took a lower dose so as not to have these side effects, he would typically have to remain in bed for seven days. When using these points to treat twisted back or back spasm, it is best to treat on the day it happens” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (chronic lumbar pain, Dr. Lee): “While visiting a clinic in China, a patient was presented to me who had lower back pain and had been treated repeatedly without much improvement. He was leaning against the wall as I inserted four needles into his chin. The other doctors watched skeptically. Only a few minutes later, the patient let out a deep cough. In that moment, everyone present simultaneously realized that the patient was radically improved. His pain was practically gone. Those of us who primarily use Master Tung’s points are not surprised by this type of instantaneous result” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Hiccups: Master Tung needled 1010.20 Water Gold to treat a patient with severe, relentless hiccups (Dr. Wang, 2013).",

This has the same function of flattening the needle shaft, using the surface of the chin as a guide, which keeps your needle trajectory as superficial as possible. Bruising: These points may bruise easily, especially if the needle is inserted too deeply. The two more lateral points are more likely to bruise. Keep the needle tip superficial enough to see it moving back toward the angle of the jaw. This prevents bleeding or bruising caused by contact with the blood vessels located in the large, strong masseter muscles. Sensitivity: While you insert the needles, watch for the patient “hard blinking” their eyes; this provides feedback on their sensitivity. Often the points are very sensitive toward the end of the needle insertion, due to the number of nerves and blood vessels in that area. In some patients, the tip of the needle may touch the masseter muscle once it is fully inserted. This is a large muscle with lots of nerves and an ample blood supply, so it can be sensitive. In this case, when the needle is removed, there may be a drop of blood, and the point may bruise a little bit. Parallel appearance: When needled together, the needle handles will be parallel to each other after insertion. Handles crossing: Depending upon the size of the ball of the patient’s chin, the needle handles may cross when 1010.20 Water Gold is needled. Alternative needle technique: Dr. Young suggested to bilaterally thread a single needle from 1010.20 Water Gold toward 1010.19 Water Through in the direction of the Lung area on the cheek. Note: I tried this technique for about six months but found four needles to be more effective. Areas of influence: This area of the face relates to water. Needling toward the left side of the face influences metal. Needling toward the right side of the face influences earth. Needle retention: On occasion I have sent patients home with these needles retained, and asked them to return for removal in a few hours. This way, in the treatment of chronic cough or chronic lower back pain, the points have more time to work. If I am needling the points “to go,” the needles must be angled slightly downward (to counteract gravity and the weight of the needle handle) and inserted 1.0 cun, so as not to walk their way out. I also show the patient how to ease them back in, as they frequently start to come out when the patient talks too much. If a needle falls out completely, the patient is instructed to bring it back to me for disposal and not to reinsert. I may teach the patient to use just acupressure without needles as a self- treatment. Depth: 0.5-1.2 cun",
        "comments": "Water Gold/Water Through with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses: I cannot speak highly enough about this combination of points and find myself using it all day, every day, in my clinic. Water Gold/Water Through points treat Kidney and Lung, while 88.17-88.19 Four Horses points treat Lung and Liver. Used together, these point patterns are extraordinary for all lung diseases, especially asthma or bronchitis due to allergies. This is always my “go-to” combination for severe common cold, bronchitis, cough, pleurisy, or emphysema. Because Four Horses strongly tonifies the qi, and Water Gold/Water Through tonifies the Kidneys, this combination is very helpful when treating chronic lung diseases of the weak or elderly, including: pneumonia, COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and lung tumors. Sometimes I also add LU5, and almost always add A.04 San Cha Three. •  Energetic pathways: Due to their location on the chin, Water Gold and Water Through are easy to locate and needle, making them very clinically useful. They are chosen to treat conditions such as cough or asthma, and they are often combined with other points to refine or hone the direction of the treatment or improve a treatment outcome (see Combinations below). These marvelous points increase the power of the Kidney qi, which comes from the Kidney and Lung, and this is reflected in the point names. “Water” indicates a connection to the Kidney, while “Gold” indicates a connection to metal and the Lungs. Water Gold/Water Through points have the Reaction Area of Kidney and were two of Master Tung’s favorite points for tonifying and strengthening the Kidneys. •  Regulating qi and blood: The Large Intestine meridian is internally connected to the Lung and goes around the mouth, ending at LI20 to connect to the Stomach meridian, and tonifying the earth to produce metal. Because the Yang Ming (ST/LI) channel has more qi and more blood, Water Gold/Water Through points are effective in regulating qi and blood, strengthening the Lung and Kidneys. •  Diagnostic clues: A green hue around the mouth and chin is a sign of Kidney weakness and could indicate chronic Kidney deficiency in cases such as asthma and lower back pain. Additionally, darkness around the eyes, especially under the eyes and/or extending through the area of the lacrimal bone, indicates extreme depletion and might also occur with dizziness, blurred vision and lower back pain. In patients who have received a kidney transplant, I have noticed extreme discoloration in this area. •  Diagnostic signs of Kidney deficiency (Dr. Lee, 1992): •  Darkness under the eyes: “These points treat Kidney weakness and fatigue, In this case, the skin under the eyes will be dark and there will be dizziness, blurred vision, low back pain, etc.” •  Greenish hue under the chin: “According to Master Tung, if the Kidney weakness is severe, one will find a greenish or darkish vein under the chin. If one needles through this, it will bleed upon withdrawal of the needle. It may also cause this area to be black and blue for a few days. If the disease is not so severe, needling this point will not result in bleeding or bruising. If the skin is darkened in this location, needling here can effectively treat a variety of diseases.” •  Facial hue in asthma: “Patients with long-term asthma due to Kidney weakness also tend to have a green or gray facial complexion. Using these two points to treat this condition lightens the face color.” •  Little finger length: The little finger usually extends beyond the crease between the second and third phalanx of the ring finger. A short little finger indicates Kidney deficiency.Breathing (KD and LU): In Chinese medicine, breathing is viewed as the Kidney qi grasping the descending Lung qi and anchoring it. If the Kidneys are not able to receive the Lung qi, breathing is long and labored. If the Lung qi is not descending, there is panting. Water Gold/Water Through points connect metal (Lung) and water (Kidney) to strongly tonify the Kidney and powerfully regulate Lung qi. They are useful for symptoms of qi reversal, such as cough, asthma, hiccups and vomiting. •  Cough, asthma or bronchitis: 22.11 Earth Water is a three-point pattern and is Tung’s version of LU10. In TCM, LU10 Yu Ji is the Ying-Spring point of the Lung meridian; it clears Lung heat and sedates fire. 1010.19 Water Through has a similar function when combined with 1010.20 Water Gold. They are my favorite points for treating acute or chronic cough, asthma or bronchitis. Though acupuncture is very effective for calming asthma, in serious cases you must combine acupuncture with herbs. Cupping the upper back, including Ding Chuan (Extra Point located next to DU14), is always useful in treating early wind chill and often asthma, as well. •  Cough (Dr. Young): “1010.20 Water Gold calms the qi. For cough in the morning needle 1010.20 Water Gold with 22.11 Earth Water (Tung’s LU10). For cough in the afternoon needle Water Gold and 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5). A very simple treatment using just these two points” (Dr. Young, 2008). •  Transporting Points: In several of Dr. Young’s lectures, he provided the following examples of Transporting Points used for cough, with seasonal and time references: Seasonal uses: •  For cough in winter or at nighttime: Use Jing-Well points. Needle one point on each side with a thin piece of ginger inside the patient’s mouth, between the cheek and gum. •  For cough in spring or in the morning: Use Ying-Spring points. •  For cough in summer or at noon: Use Shu-Stream points. •  For cough in fall or afternoon: Use He-Sea points. Horary times:•  3:00–9:00 a.m. = morning: Use Ying-Spring points. •  9:00–3:00 p.m. = noon: Use Shu-Stream points. •  3:00–9:00 p.m. = afternoon: Use He–Sea points. •  9:00–3:00 a.m. = night: Use Jing–Well points. •  Low back pain (Active Qi Moving): I love the effects of Water Gold/Water Through in strengthening the lower back and legs, and have used them successfully many times over the years in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. Due to their location on the chin, these points allow the patient to gently walk around while the needles are retained (Active Qi Moving). I typically ask the patient to walk around the clinic. If this is not possible they may walk outside, though if they are elderly, I am reluctant to send them out of my sight.•  Acute lumbar sprain (Dr. Young): Needling opposite-side 1010.19 Water Through and 1010.13 Horse Gold Water offers immediate relief for acute lumbar sprain. Needle bilaterally if the condition affects both sides. The sooner you can needle these points after the onset of the condition, the more effective the treatment will be (Dr. Young, 2008).Note: For acute lumbar sprain, I also recommend the following treatments: 1.  Bleed veins found in the popliteal crease (UB39-UB40 area). 2.  Cup the lumbar/sacral area. 3.  Needle 11.12 Er Jiao Ming. •  Male sexual disorders: Water Through tonifies deficient Kidney qi, increasing energy (including sexual energy), and it is used to treat impotence, paralysis, and weakness in the legs. Kidney qi, derived from Kidney and Lung, is also a factor in prostate enlargement.•  Impotence and premature ejaculation: Needling 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/Water Through strongly tonifies the Kidney qi. However, the best point for impotence is LV1 Da Dun, the wood point on a wood channel, which opens orifices and drains dampness, and is a good point to relieve stress from nervousness. The Liver channel passes through and around the genitals, and LV1 Da Dun is a Jing-Well point that clears heat, frees the channels and calms the spirit. Premature ejaculation happens when the Kidney is hard to control; needle 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors to treat both impotence and premature ejaculation. •  Arthritis pain due to Kidney (Dr. Lee): “These points treat joint pain due to Kidney deficiency. In this case, the kidneys are not adequately removing uric acid, which then deposits in the joints as crystals. One can tell if arthritis is due to Kidney deficiency by blackness or darkness of the chin” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (acute back strain, Dr. Lee): “A physician came to my office at 6:00 am one day. That morning, while putting on his shoes, his back went into spasm. I needled these four points and had him walk around, twisting his back, lifting his legs, and trying to mobilize his back as much as possible. After the treatment, he returned home and took a short nap. At 10:00 am that same morning he went to his office and saw patients all day as usual. This doctor reported to me that when this had happened to him before, if he took very strong medicine for such back spasms, he had to stay in bed for three days and then would have side effects of headache and stomachache. If he took a lower dose so as not to have these side effects, he would typically have to remain in bed for seven days. When using these points to treat twisted back or back spasm, it is best to treat on the day it happens” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (chronic lumbar pain, Dr. Lee): “While visiting a clinic in China, a patient was presented to me who had lower back pain and had been treated repeatedly without much improvement. He was leaning against the wall as I inserted four needles into his chin. The other doctors watched skeptically.4 Only a few minutes later, the patient let out a deep cough. In that moment, everyone present simultaneously realized that the patient was radically improved. His pain was practically gone. Those of us who primarily use Master Tung’s points are not surprised by this type of instantaneous result” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Hiccups: Master Tung needled 1010.20 Water Gold to treat a patient with severe, relentless hiccups (Dr. Wang, 2013).",

The left side relates to males (Lung – qi), while the right side relates to females (Liver – blood). Needling technique: Pushing gently against the tip of the nose will cause the nasal ala to flare out and give you more room to needle. To desensitize the point, place the tip of the needle against the point and press it in without inserting (similar to the technique for needling finger points). Then, insert quickly without bouncing, making sure not to hit the septum inside the nose. Stimulation: Provide strong stimulation for a few seconds, then leave the needle alone. Painful point: This point is very painful when needled. It is fine once you get through the nose, but be sure not to hit the septum, as this would be excruciating. Needling this point always makes the patient’s eyes water. Warn the patient ahead of time so they will not feel embarrassed about crying. Retention time: Retain the needle for at least one hour. If left longer, it will be more energizing, but do not leave the needle overnight. Many students ask to have this point needled at the end of an intense three-day seminar, when they have a long distance to drive before they sleep.

Due to overwork, a quick temper, and suppressed anger, qi may congest in the supraorbital bone. If the patient pushes him/herself and never rests, they may tighten their jaws.

        "techniques": "Needle perpendicularly 0.1 - 0.3 cun or obliquely, touching the bone. Needling to touch the skull will stimulate the Kidney to help treat spinal pain. This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Patient positioning: When inserting State Water, be sure that the patient does not hold their chin down. If they hold their chin down, the neck is tight, and it should be relaxed when these points are needled. Needle technique: Start by sliding your finger up the center of the back of the neck into the posterior hairline, locating the occipital notch and parting the hair. Move up and over the notch until your finger is centered on the top of the occipital protuberance. Insert the needle horizontally downward, flattening the shaft of the needle against the patient’s head in order to thread it superficially. The second needle is located 0.8 cun superior to the first and is also threaded superficially downward until it contacts the first needle. Occasionally, a needle will tap the bone of the occipital protuberance. If this occurs, back the needle out slightly and use a curving needle technique to lift the tip of the needle up and over the bone. You may need to pull up a bit of hair/scalp just above the shaft of the needle to create a space for the needle to slide over the bone. Rotating the neck: After insertion, have the patient rotate their head to the left and right to verify that there is no muscular tension on the needles. Combining with other needles to treat low back pain: I often combine State Water with 55.04 Flower Bone Three and 55.05 Flower Bone Four. I needle State Water first, while the patient is standing. Because patients with lower back pain have an extremely difficult time lying on their stomach, once I have needled Flower Bone Three and Flower Bone Four with the patient lying face down on the table, I then help them sit up by swinging their legs over the side of the table. From this position it is easier for them to pivot their hips and lie back down, face up. Carefully cup the back of their head, with your hand covering the needles, while they reposition their head on the pillow. Because the State Water needles are inserted horizontally beneath the skin, they are flattened between the head and the pillow as long as the patient does not move around. Place a bolster under the legs, elevating the feet to avoid putting additional stress on the lumbar spine. This is a comfortable position for the patient to maintain during a treatment of at least one hour. Depth: 0.5-0.8 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: “Water” in the point name indicates that these points relate to the Kidney. State Water points are located on the DU channel and therefore can treat the entire spine, but are especially good for the lumbar spine and specifically the area of L5-S1. The DU Mai warms the yang and treats weakness of the lower limbs. Herniated disc (L5-S1): When I am treating a severely protruding disk at L5-S1, I often needle State Water in combination with 55.04-55.05 Flower Bone Three/Flower Bone Four. State Water sends the qi down the spine, whereas Flower Bone Three and Flower Bone Four send the qi up the spine; the qi meets at the hinge (L5-S1 area). Also consider bleeding veins found in the popliteal crease (UB39-UB40 area) to release pressure in the lower back. If there is severe sciatica, bleed DT.08 or DT.09 (palpate for tenderness). See needling instructions above for combining State Water with Flower Bone Three and Flower Bone Four. Treating low back pain (Dr. Lee): “I use State Water quite often to treat lower back pain. While the needles are in place, I have the patient mobilize their lower back. The treatment should continue until their pain or numbness is relieved.",

        "comments": "11.01-11.05 are collectively known as the Hernia Points: They are most frequently used for hernia. These points are not used for hiatal hernia.

LV1 Da Dun can be used as a Guiding Point. 11.05 Middle Distance regulates the heart rate: In an emergency situation, if a needle is not available, bury your fingernail into the point to relieve chest pain due to angina. In the clinic, when treating a patient with an irregular heart rate, I usually needle Middle Distance on its own for ten minutes to stabilize the heart before proceeding. This is especially helpful in the treatment of elderly patients. Please remember this point; in an emergency it can make a difference between life and death. Moxibustion and bleeding to treat hernia: Place a moxa pot or moxa heat pack with padding on the bulging hernia to cause it to shrink. Bleed small veins in the vicinity of the medial malleolus to treat hernia and many other lower jiao conditions. Energetic pathways: The Hand Yang Ming (LI) meridian connects with the Foot Jue Yin (LV) meridian, so there are many Liver indications for these points, including vertigo, blurred vision and urethritis. Due to the internal/external connection between the Large Intestine and Lung, the points also treat bronchitis and yellow phlegm. Because fingers correspond to the lower jiao, there are also indications such as hernia, urinary bladder infection, urethra and uterine pain.

I was visiting a famous hospital there and talked to a young doctor in the emergency room where cardiac patients were brought. Nowadays in China heart attack patients are treated with a combination of modern Western medicines and traditional Chinese medicines administered intravenously. In China today, mostly what they know about acupuncture is the twelve or fourteen regular channel system. I thought to show the doctors in this hospital something about Master Tung’s extraordinary points. I showed this young doctor in the emergency room 11.05 Middle Distance and told him its indications and that it is especially good for heart conditions. Some time later, a man was brought into the emergency room suffering from a heart attack. His face was cyanotic and he could not breathe freely. Middle Distance is also indicated for trouble breathing. Therefore, this young doctor picked up a short needle and immediately inserted it in the area of Middle Distance.

        "techniques": "Needle 0.2 - 0.3 cun . The effect to treat the KI channel is enhanced when the needle tip touches the bone. Alternatively, it can also be needled from the dorsal aspect of the phalange, adjacent to the edge of the bone (cutting or shaving the bone technique). | Johnson: Needle unilaterally only: It is fine to needle either side (usually combined with 11.24 Gynecological Points on the opposite hand). Needle size and gauge: I use a 15mm x 0.16 needle (Japanese 1 gauge or Chinese 40 gauge), inserted just palmar to the intersection of red and white skin in order to avoid immediately striking the side of the phalange. In order to wrap the needle under the bone, I use a curving needle technique, inserting the tip and then introducing a curve in the shaft by holding the handle at a 90-degree angle to the tip. The goal is to insert the needle between the bone and the tendon, as this provides a Kidney function by contacting the palmar surface of the bone (bone treats bone) and a Liver function (tendon treats tendon). Point Location and Needling Technique, for curving needle technique on this point. Avoiding blood vessels: It is important to look carefully for blood vessels, as they are frequently found in the area of this point. Vessels may not be obvious, but I have learned an effective way to identify them. Blood vessels beneath the surface cast a shadow, which causes the skin to appear slightly darker than the surrounding area. If we look carefully and choose the more pink or white skin (relatively speaking, considering skin tone), we are far more likely to avoid blood vessels. If the patient feels a sharp burning sensation when Return to the Nest is needled, you have struck a blood vessel. Remove the needle and start again. If you should hit a blood vessel, note its location in your chart so you can avoid it in the future. Pegging a tendon: You have pegged a tendon if you see a small depression around the needle where it enters the skin. It will not be particularly sensitive, but the finger will not be able to move at all and the needle will not rotate easily to stimulate the point. If this happens, withdraw the needle until its tip is just under the epidermis and redirect it slightly. Needle stimulation: I often apply strong stimulation to the needle once it is in place, rotating quickly, clockwise and counterclockwise, carefully watching the patient’s eyes for any sign of discomfort (hard blinking). As this point is used to open blocked fallopian tubes and stop menstrual cramps immediately, strong stimulation is required. 5 Cited in Dr. Wang (2013) 39 Finger Points Needle retention: Retain the needle for 45 minutes to one hour or until you recognize that the treatment is complete. Combining points for gynecological issues: 11.17 Wood (Anger) is frequently used in combination with Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. When combining these points, first needle 11.17 Wood (Anger) and 11.24 Gynecological Points on the patient’s left hand, followed by 11.06 Return to the Nest on the right hand. This arrangement allows you to best position the patient’s hands after needling, because the Gynecological Points combine better with Wood (Anger) than with Return to the Nest. If you are needling the points multiple times in one week (or even daily in the case of infertility) you can alternate the arrangement by needling Wood (Anger) with Return to the Nest on the patient’s left hand, and needling Gynecological Points on the right hand. We always needle Wood (Anger) on the left side (opposite the liver). Gynecological Points and Return to the Nest can be needled on either hand, and each can be needled unilaterally, but they should never both be needled on the same hand. Alternative needling methods: Other Tung’s points practitioners describe needling Return to the Nest by picking up the point at the junction of red and white skin (E-line or A-line), from a dorsal direction. In my opinion, once the finger is relaxed, the location appears the same as in the manner described above. I like using a curving needle technique on Return to the Nest because the Kidney governs hormones and bones, and bone treats bone, so by bringing the shaft of the needle into contact with the palmar surface of the bone, we create a strong Kidney tonification. Depth: 0.3.0 cun",
        "comments": "11.06 combined with 11.24: Unilaterally needled, primarily for women, Return to the Nest is usually combined with 11.24 Gynecological Points to treat all gynecological diseases, as it regulates female hormones. Return to the Nest has a stronger effect on the ovaries, whereas 11.24 Gynecological Points adjusts the qi of the uterus. 11.06 regulates blood (cycles), while 11.24 regulates qi. Function: Return to the Nest releases Liver qi stagnation, quiets the womb, and calms the fetus. It has a strong tonification and regulatory effect on the Kidney, Liver and San Jiao. Cyclical symptoms: Any symptoms that are cyclic in nature have an ovarian component because the ovaries regulate the menstrual rhythm. Dysmenorrhea: 11.06 relieves dysmenorrhea better than SP6 San Yin Jiao because Return to the Nest prevents acute or chronic cramping from reoccurring. However, SP6 with electrical stimulation is more effective for intense cramping, especially on the first day of the period once full bleeding has commenced. Unfortunately, this powerful effect is only temporary and cannot be implemented prior to menstruation. Pregnancy: Return to the Nest quiets the womb and calms the fetus; therefore, it can be used in any kind of pregnancy-related illness. Points that are used to treat infertility are always safe to use during pregnancy. This knowledge is helpful, as the patient may not know when she has conceived. Labor and delivery: See Comments, KD1 Yong Quan for an ‘Easy Delivery Formula’ and induction protocol. Energetic pathways: In the name of this point, “nest” refers to the womb. Multiple channels affect female reproductive organs, but primarily we think of the Liver and Kidney channels. Return to the Nest is located on the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) channel and is used to regulate hormones (ovaries) because of the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and the Foot Shao Yin (KD). The Hand and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB) connect to the Liver through the internal/external relationship between the Gallbladder and Liver. This makes Return to the Nest effective in the treatment of PMS (irritability and depression), irregular menstrual cycles, dysmenorrhea, cyclic migraines, and any gynecological issue related to the Liver and hormonal functions. We can also derive a Liver connection through the Hand and Foot Jue Yin relationship, as the Hand Jue Yin (PC) channel splits at PC8 Lao Gong and proceeds to the tips of the middle and ring fingers, connecting with the San Jiao channel through Return to the Nest. 11.06 combined with 11.17 Wood (Anger) : Tung’s fantastic points, 11.17 Wood (Anger), are also related to Liver and PMS. This is because female reproductive issues such as breast pain, migraines, irritability, depression, dysmenorrhea, fibroid cysts and tumors, and emotional instability due to menopause are often associated with Liver imbalance. Diagnostic tools: When there is pain in the lower jiao, I often use opposite-side 66.05 Golden Gate and Return to the Nest as diagnostic tools. Golden Gate usually clears any kind of gastrointestinal discomfort. If it does not relieve the pain, I remove the needle and then needle Return to the Nest with strong stimulation. If there is still no change, the discomfort is likely urinary in origin. Tipped uterus: Return to the Nest treats lower back pain due to tipped uterus. The uterus does not tilt without a reason, and usually the cause is multiple fibroids or tumors putting pressure on the bladder and the nerves of the lower back, thus causing frequent urination and lower back pain. Also see 11.24 Gynecological Points, Comments. Yoga pose for retroverted uterus: Retroverted uterus can also be caused by holding the urine too long or not getting enough bed rest after childbirth. When this condition is treated with 11.06 and 11.24, the patient should be asked to do the following exercise (Child’s Pose in Hatha yoga) twice daily, in the morning before arising and at night before going to bed. With an empty bladder, the woman should kneel down, lay her chest on her thighs, and stretch her arms out over her head for a few minutes. This increases the angle of the hips to more than 90 degrees, allowing gravity to help pull the uterus forward (Dr. Lee, 1992). Uterine pain due to abortion: “For uterine pain due to abortion, use only 11.06. In my experience, bilateral needling of SP6 San Yin Jiao only relieves this pain for about 10 minutes. With one needle, Return to the Nest relieves such pain for four to five hours. For uterine pain with pus due to infection, use this point with REN3 Zhong Ji and Zi Gong (Extra Points 3.0 cun lateral to REN3). Four or five treatments will relieve the pain” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Bleeding technique: Look for blood vessels in the area of SP6 San Yin Jiao, often associated with lower jiao stagnation. Use pricking bleeding techniques to bleed these vessels, and needle 11.06 and 11.24. This bleeding technique is also effective for urinary and lower bowel disorders. Neck and shoulder pain: Because Return to the Nest is found on the San Jiao channel, it functions like SJ5 Wai Guan in the treatment of neck, shoulder and upper arm pain. I would never choose it specifically to treat musculoskeletal issues, but patients might tell you that their pain has improved after receiving this point. Infertility: If the patient’s little finger does not extend to the crease between the second and third phalange of the ring finger, it is diagnostic for Kidney deficiency and is always a sign of infertility (Dr. Young, 2008). Male reproductive: Dr. Wang cites Dr. Liu in saying that Return to the Nest can be used to treat prostatitis (due to cold evil) in older males because it promotes the yang qi of the San Jiao. My dear friend, Dr. Ta Viet Hoang, has used Return to the Nest successfully in treating scrotal inflammation.",

These points are outstandingly effective in the treatment of chronic or deficient knee pain, especially with the elderly.

It is better not to use this point than to needle it incorrectly. Wood Fire may be needled safely every other day, even once daily, but never more than one time each day. Stroke: Because Wood Fire strongly warms the Yang, opens the orifices and disperses cold, it is extremely useful in post-stroke treatment. Its name, Wood Fire, comes from its location between the wood and fire points of the Pericardium channel. Liver (wind) and Pericardium (fire) share a Jue Yin connection, and we use them both to treat the Heart and circulation. Dr. Lee sometimes referred to these points as Wood Phlegm, because stroke has to do with Liver wind rising and phlegm masking the orifices. Wood, wind, phlegm and fire are all implicated in the use of Mu Huo after a stroke. After needling Mu Huo in an acute post-stroke treatment, we may then choose opposite side 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai (also located between wood and fire points) with GB31 and GB32 (88.25 and A.01), also on the opposite side. Be sure to use Active Qi Moving technique after needling the above points. See 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB21) for my comprehensive hemiplegia/stroke protocol. Cold extremities: As useful as it is for stroke, I am far more likely to use Wood Fire to treat the freezing cold extremities of my elderly patients. Because many of them take high blood pressure medications, I am equally cautious in my observation of the needle retention time restrictions. I always needle Mu Huo alone, so as to not be distracted by needling other points. Then, I often add 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points and moxa heat packs (lower abdominal and lower back) for a dynamite warming effect. Energetic pathways: The Reaction Area of Mu Huo is the Heart and Liver. Because we can access both of these through the Pericardium, and because both the Heart and Liver meridians travel to the head (the Liver meridian passing through the throat), the Pericardium meridian is chosen particularly for stroke, aphasia due to stroke, blood circulation and heart disease. Medial knee pain: Mu Huo is used to treat medial knee pain (often due to bone spurs); however, for this I find 33.12 Heart Gate to be exceptional.",

Varicose veins: “Varicose veins are due to heart and lung weakness. These points tonify Lung qi, which can be difficult to build up. Because the heart pumps blood out to the limbs, and the lungs draw blood back to the trunk, weakness of the heart and lungs may result in blood collecting in the limbs. In this case, every bone in the spine may feel painful to palpation. In addition, the legs may be bloated and distended with varicose veins. Women who use long-term synthetic hormonal replacement therapies and patients who take daily hormone replacements (sex change therapy) may experience this kind of pain and congestion” (Dr. Lee, 1992).

Restless sleeping is related to the Pericardium/Heart connection. Sudden awakening or being easily startled, with an accompanying rapid heart rate, has to do with weakness in the Gallbladder, or in Traditional Chinese Medicine terms, “empty Gallbladder.” Energetic pathways (knee pain): These points’ effectiveness in the treatment of knee pain is partly due to the connection between Hand Shao Yin (HT) and Foot Shao Yang (GB); they are also effective because the Pericardium has a close relationship to the Heart, Stomach and Liver, all of which relate to the knee. As Master Tung’s system has many points from which to choose, I might choose these for knee pain if there are also Gallbladder indications. Nocturnal distress: “When a mother eats spicy food, it passes into her milk and is consumed by her baby. Spicy food attacks the Lung, and excess Lung energy over- controls the Liver, which causes the baby to cry all day and night. For babies who cry at night, needle both points once per week. For persistent cases, 3-4 treatments ought to be sufficient” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Fire Knee is located at SI1 Shao Ze, the Jing-Well and metal point on a fire channel, and has the Reaction Area of Heart. It has the functions of opening the orifices, clearing heat, and opening the Heart, and is used for resuscitation. Rheumatoid arthritis: Bleeding this point is very effective for rheumatoid arthritis (phlegm) with deformed joints, especially in the hands. Mental illness: Phlegm masking the orifices is a frequent cause of mental disturbance. This phlegm is foamy and frothy, not sticky like that which comes from the Lung. Anger may especially induce this type of phlegm obstruction. Due to the connection between the Small Intestine and Heart, and the Tai Yang (SI) relationship to the Du Mai, spine and brain, Fire Knee clears the mind. “If phlegm obstructs the orifices of the Heart, the person will seem rational one moment and nod their head in understanding. Then the next moment they will forget everything they were just told” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Tai Yang channel disorders: This point is indicated by difficulty in raising the arm and has a special effect for pain in the Hand Tai Yang (SI) meridian. Fire Knee is effective for treating frozen shoulder because of the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yang (SI) and the Leg Tai Yin (SP), through which the Spleen channel relates to the back of the shoulder, while the Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP) relate to the front of the shoulder.",

With all other conditions, needle the side opposite to the problem. For bloating due to Liver overacting on Spleen, needle both sides. This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Needle unilaterally: Wood (Anger) points are usually needled on the left side only (opposite the liver organ) to treat emotional issues related to Liver qi. Needle bilaterally: Wood (Anger) points are needled on both sides to treat sinus problems, dry or tearing eyes, skin diseases on the hands, and extremely sweaty palms. Nerve sensation: If the patient feels a “zing” toward the tip of the finger, you have struck a nerve. Nerves are hard to avoid because you cannot see them. Remove the needle completely and do not reinsert it until the next treatment. Carefully note the location of the nerve in your chart. Hitting a nerve is not necessarily painful, and it may cause only a slight sensation; however, stimulating the point or leaving the needle in may cause repeated electrical “zings” in the weeks to come. The patient will not like this and will think of you frequently, for the wrong reasons. This is a two-point combination: The proximal point is the Chief Point; the distal point is the Supporting Point. In many cases, needling the proximal point is sufficient. If the patient is extremely angry or very depressed, needle both points. Helpful hints: There are a few tricks to facilitate the needling of these points. Use your non-needling hand to hold the back of the patient’s left hand securely in your palm. Arch back their wrist, using the side of your hand at their dorsal wrist crease. Secure their index, middle and ring fingers in an open position. You also may want to secure the patient’s thumb inside a ring made by the thumb and index finger of your needling hand. If the patient applies any pressure to your needling hand with their thumb, suggest that they hold their own little finger and thumb together, making it easier for you to needle without their interference. Avoiding blood vessels: For the comfortable needling of the palmar surface of the hand, perhaps the most crucial step is to very carefully scan the area for faint or obvious blood vessels. Look for the pink or white skin and avoid any area, however small, that has a blue or greenish hue. Tiny adjustments to avoid blood vessels make a huge difference in the patient’s comfort when these points are needled. Do not use a guide tube: Point location on the fingers needs to be precise; therefore, it is not advisable to use a guide tube. First, place the tip of the needle on the point with firm pressure to desensitize the skin. After pausing for a few seconds, and without bouncing, quickly insert the needle through the first millimeter of the skin (the most sensitive area). After a quick and shallow penetration of the surface, incrementally bounce the needle to a deeper level, testing along the way to be sure that you are not “pegging” a tendon or tapping the bone. The needle needs to be free in its correct position, so pay very close attention to the tissues through which the needle passes and to any body language expressing the patient’s sensitivity. Positioning: With the dorsal surface of the patient’s fingers lying gently against the palmar surface of your own fingers, you will be able to feel the pressure of the progressing needle tip. Stop before it penetrates the underside of the epidermis, as this is just as sensitive as the exterior surface.

        "comments": "Cautions: 11.17 vs. 11.20: Wood (Anger) points are needled for Liver qi stagnation, whereas 11.20 Wood Inflammation points are for liver organ disease and pain. For patients with serious liver organ issues such as hepatitis, cirrhosis or liver cancer, Wood (Anger) points are NOT the points to choose. For those cases, 11.20 Wood Inflammation points are a better choice. Wood Inflammation is priceless in treating liver organ diseases but should never be used in combination with Wood (Anger), as they are too powerful to combine and would make the patient feel ill. Irritability and anger: Excellent for easing stress, these points can be added to any Liver calming treatment. They are exceptional for treating Liver qi stagnation and Liver fire rising, with a tight pulse, anger, irritability, and depression. These points expel heat to clear the head and eyes, open the orifices, resuscitate, and promote smooth circulation of Liver qi. Wood Anger Points: Dr. Lee fondly called this two-point combination the “Wood Anger Points,” because they have a profound effect upon the nervous system and liver. I call them the “Million Dollar Points,” because if I had ten cents for every time they have come in handy, I’d be a millionaire. These points soothe the savage beast. If the patient is in a manic state of rage, needle these points immediately. The Liver needs to stretch out, to be big and free to speak, and to say just how it feels. A patient who has Liver qi congestion, and who cannot speak their truth for any reason, gets tighter and tighter until they are boiling mad. This is the setup for a migraine. When this anger is still not allowed expression, it turns inward on itself and becomes severe depression. These days, people carry the weight of the world on their shoulders, and the resulting stress and frustration is the cause of most one-sided headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, insomnia, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety. In these cases, I often begin treatment with cupping and needling, and sometimes even bleeding. However, it is also necessary to help people learn to release frustration and tension in a way that is useful to them and does not harm others. Premenstrual: These points can be especially sensitive if the patient is premenstrual or having a hard time emotionally. I judge a female patient’s level of Liver qi stagnation based on the degree of her premenstrual breast pain. If she has no breast pain, I consider her Liver qi congestion to be mild. If she has breast pain for a day or two, she clearly needs a little help. If she has two weeks of breast pain before her period, this indicates a serious case of Liver qi and blood stagnation. Often, such a patient also has nausea and vomiting with severe menstrual cramping. Energetic pathways: Wood (Anger) lends a powerful wind influence due to the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and the Foot Jue Yin (LV). This is seen in its association with emotional states (such as irritability, anger and depression), as well as with sinus congestion and blurred vision, as the Liver channel passes deeply through the inside of the throat and sinuses on its way to the top of the head. These points are also very effective in the treatment of skin and sinus issues due to the internal/external connection between the Large Intestine and Lung, as well as the Large Intestine/Liver relationship. The large intestine and liver organs both clean toxins from the body; the Lung governs the skin and keeps it healthy, and opens to the nose. Wood (Anger) points are used to treat skin conditions on the hands, usually in combination with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses. Of note, the Wood (Anger) points are located on the Koryo Hand Therapy (KHT) Lung channel, reinforcing their relationship to the skin and sinuses. Urinary bladder infections: In my clinic, I have found that most women with bladder infections have been extremely angry in the 24 hours preceding onset. The rising Liver fire hits the Heart, transferring the heat to the Small Intestine and thereby the Urinary Bladder. Because I so frequently see this connection, my first question to a woman with a bladder infection is, “Did you recently get really angry?” Ten times out of ten, the answer is, “Yes!” 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2) is also an important point to treat this condition because it is the Ying-Spring and fire point on the Liver meridian which flows through the genitals, and thus it clears heat. Void after sex: I always advise patients to urinate after sex in order to flush bacteria from their urethra. This simple practice can stop many infections from taking hold. Liver qi stagnation: I use Wood (Anger) points multiple times daily in my clinic, with excellent results. They are particularly useful because of their extraordinary effect of releasing Liver qi stagnation, and because they can easily be combined with any other treatment protocol to open the flow of energy throughout the entire nervous system. Patients absolutely love these points and often ask for them to be needled. They know that no matter what their practitioner chooses to address during their visit, they will very likely go home feeling happy and relaxed.",

Cautions: • Forbidden to needle during pregnancy.Phlegm: Similar to 11.11 Lung Heart, Heart Normal resolves frothy phlegm due to anger, not sticky phlegm from the Lung. Energetic pathways: Dr. Lee used the metaphor of a balloon to represent the heart, and said that treating the heart directly by needling Heart channel points is like popping the balloon with a pin. In Tung’s point system, we choose one of two methods to affect the Heart. If the patient has a Heart excess condition, we sedate the Stomach (child) to let the air out of the balloon slowly, from the opening at the bottom. If the patient has a deficiency, we tonify the Liver (mother) in order to replenish. Because the Pericardium is the Heart Protector, points on the Pericardium channel are always chosen over points on the Heart channel. The Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST) share a powerful energetic connection, so we often choose the Stomach channel to treat the Heart through the Pericardium. Additionally, the Hand and Foot Jue Yin connect the Pericardium to the Liver. Thus, the Pericardium serves as an intermediary that connects to both the Stomach (excess) and the Liver (deficiency) in balancing the Heart. Heart disease: For enlarged heart and heart disease, bleed DT.07 Three Gold (Shu Points close to HT, PC, SI and LU). Case history (phlegm obstructing the Heart, Dr. Lee): “Once in Singapore I was asked to treat an old woman who was quite sick. Several years before she had retired and given her business to her daughter-in-law. Her daughter-in-law then turned on this woman and would not give her any money, only fed her once per day, and treated her very badly. Of course the mother-in-law was filled with sorrow, hatred, and regret. Finally, her friends took her to their house and tried to care for her. When I came to try to treat this woman, I prescribed herbs that I then boiled myself. I tried to give these to this woman, but she just poured them out on the floor. This woman did not know what she was doing. This was a case of phlegm obstructing the portals of the Heart due to years of harboring ill will and other negative feelings” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

The combination of these energetic  relationships makes Wood Inflammation points some of the most powerful in Tung’s system of acupuncture. •  Function: 11.17 Wood (Anger) is needled for Liver qi stagnation (emotional issues), whereas 11.20 Wood Inflammation is selected for liver organ disease and liver pain, because 11.20 clears heat and calms fire (serious organ disease). •  Channel sensitivity: Some patients with advanced liver disease may find 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows too painful to be needled or even palpated, especially if they are premenstrual. In this case, start with Wood Inflammation and add Three Yellows at a future time when the patient is better able to tolerate them. An herbal formula will most certainly hasten that time and is required in any kind of serious liver disease. •  Exhaustion due to liver: Patients with hepatitis are often exhausted. They are tired not due to qi deficiency but because their liver is not cleaning the blood properly, and their blood has become “dirty,” or toxic (Dr. Lee, 1992). If you tonify the qi in these patients, you will worsen their condition. First, clean the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas by thoroughly cupping, following the color until clear margins are reached. If the skin color is black after cupping, the patient may feel more fatigued the following day, although most patients will feel lighter and more energetic due to their liver’s improved functioning. •  Case histories (hepatitis and HIV) : In the mid 1980s, I had an HIV clinic in San Francisco, where I saw many extreme cases of combined hepatitis and HIV. My patients’ elevated transaminase levels ranged between 600 and 1600 (far beyond the normal level of 0-40 units per liter of serum). These patients were hospitalized for caregiving and monitoring only, as Western medicine had no recourse with which to treat them. In extreme cases, symptoms often included headaches, insomnia, liver pain, nosebleeds, exhaustion, anger and depression, constipation or diarrhea, jaundice, back pain, nausea and vomiting. Only TCM is able to resolve this degree of severity, with 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows, cupping DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, and a Chinese herbal formula to strongly clean and detoxify the liver. As this was during the early stages of the HIV epidemic, many allopathic physicians did not know how to help this community of patients. I was gratefully welcomed in the AIDS wards in all of San Francisco’s major hospitals. Doctors and nurses came into the rooms to watch me work; families cooked my herbal teas, which were then administered at the proper times by the nursing staff. Many patients were well enough to go home within days of their treatment, with liver enzyme levels below 200. •  Polycystic liver and kidneys: I have successfully treated several cases of polycystic kidney disease, often with multiple cysts in the liver. Because the liver and the kidneys both need to be treated, a point combination including 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan) is utilized. First, I needle 11.20 Wood Inflammation, and then in order to keep the number of needles to a minimum, I use either 88.12 and 88.14 Two Yellows with Shen Guan, or 88.12 Bright Yellow with 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors, perhaps alternating the two options. If the patient has an advanced or terminal disease, I treat them as often as possible; three treatments a week may be necessary to manage their condition.",
        "combinations": "For all liver disease: SI4 Wan Gu is an excellent choice for clearing damp heat. •  Wood attacking earth (diarrhea): If Liver and Spleen are both affected, needle 88.12- 88.14 Three Yellows, 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate. •  Cirrhosis: •  Bleed Liver, Gallbladder and Spleen Shu points. •  Unilaterally needle left side 11.20 Wood Inflammation, bilaterally needle 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows. •  Unilaterally needle left side 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.11 Liver Gate, bilaterally needle 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows. •  Alternatively, use left side 33.11 Liver Gate with bilateral 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/ Wood Scoop. Note: In my experience, the Wood Keep/Wood Scoop points have mixed results when used for liver and blood diseases",

For best results, bleed the points and squeeze out the dark blood. | Johnson: Bleed: Though Control Dirt is described as being a three-point pattern, it is never needled, only bled, and only when an extremely dark vessel is seen. A lancet is adequate for bleeding in this case. For easier bleeding, warm the patient’s hands. On cold or rainy days, patients do not bleed as well.",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Control Dirt is located on the Lung channel. Because the Lung governs the skin and the Liver cleans the blood, these points are used to treat infections and abscesses, utilizing the relationship of metal controlling wood. Also relevant is the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and the Foot Tai Yang (UB); the former governs the Wei qi, and the latter is frequently attacked by external wind. This point is located between the Jing-Well and Ying-Spring points; the Ying-Spring points treat exterior diseases. Dark vessels on the dorsal thumb: Students in my classes are often dismayed to find dark vessels on the back of their own thumbs, yet these vessels are rarely as dark as what we are looking for. The photo above does not show a blood vessel, as they are not common; it is for point location only. Every dark vessel on the dorsum of the thumb does not mean that there is a corresponding infection. However, when we find a very dark vessel in this area, we need to ascertain whether there is an infection somewhere in the body, perhaps unknown to the patient. If your patient has shingles (herpes zoster) or a known infection or abscess, check this area. If I see a black vessel in this area, I am inclined to bleed it just for good measure. Persistent infection: Bleed Control Dirt when there is a wound that will not heal, such as a postsurgical incision with continuous drainage, difficult bedsores, any kind of severe toxin in the body, persistent infection or necrotic tissue. Black blood vs. yellow fluid: “If black blood comes out when this point is bled, the condition will heal quickly, even overnight. If yellow fluid comes out, the condition will not heal” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Bleeding the area surrounding the external malleolus: In the treatment of shingles, herpes, or otitis media, we may also bleed the small vessels found in the area of the external malleolus. Also consider bleeding 99.08 Ear Apex for these conditions. Case history (non-healing wound, Master Tung): “An 11-year-old boy had surgery on his leg. After the operation the wound would not close and was constantly weeping. The boy was in the hospital for one week and his father was very worried. He went to see Master Tung and asked for his help. Master Tung had to sneak into the hospital. He bled these points on the dorsal side of the boy’s thumb at about 11:00 am in the morning. By 3:00 pm that afternoon the weeping had stopped and the boy was discharged, whereas before bleeding Control Dirt, the nurses had to change the dressings hourly” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

        "comments": "Five Tigers are primarily used to treat musculoskeletal joint pain. “Tigers” implies a quick and powerful effect.

Never needle all five points together in one session; choose points to treat either the hands or the feet. Neural connections: The thumb is our grasping and laboring tool, important to our evolution. Many of Master Tung’s most powerful points are located on the thumb and fingers. The motor and sensory lines found in scalp acupuncture connect with a very large area of projection related to the thumb (especially) and also the fingers. Five Tigers are amazingly effective because of this strong connection to the brain and nervous system. Sore throat: Five Tigers are located on the Lung channel and tonify the Lung and Spleen. Due to this location, they can be selected to treat sore throat, pneumonia, and swollen glands. Frontal headache: Five Tigers Three may treat frontal headaches; however, this would only be a side effect of its use, as there are far more powerful points to choose.",

Avoid obvious blood vessels when needling. Guide tube: When inserting these needles, I use a guide tube, asking the patient to cough while I tap in the needle. I ask the patient to cough again while I quickly insert the needle to depth. Stimulation: On the palmar surface of the hands, I use very thin needles (0.16 x 30mm) and stimulate them gently and carefully due to palmar sensitivity. Because of the prevalent nerve and blood supply and the strength of this muscle, strong stimulation is unnecessary. Be sure to watch the patient’s eyes and stop stimulation of the needles if you observe hard blinking, which indicates pain. Positioning after insertion: With these needles, the most comfortable resting position is with the patient’s hand on its side, palm facing the body. I may place a rolled-up hand towel under the wrist if the patient prefers it. The patient may be less comfortable if the needles are vertical or hanging downward. Unilateral vs. bilateral needling: These points are usually needled on the opposite side to treat neck and scapular pain. However, they can be needled bilaterally for bilateral Tai Yang (UB) neck pain, especially when it is not possible to needle 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons.",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Due to the Tai Yin/Tai Yang connection between the Lung and Urinary Bladder meridians, Double Child/Double Fairy points are instantly effective in the treatment of upper back, scapular, and Tai Yang neck pain. If the patient also has upper respiratory issues and/or gastroenteritis, these points will address those conditions as well as upper back and neck pain (22.11/LU10 area). However, I typically choose them only for scapular and neck pain. •  Imaging: Though they are always used together, Double Fairy treats the neck while Double Child treats the scapula and upper back. •  Diagnostics: Dark blood vessels found at the proximal end of the thenar eminence are diagnostic of uterine fibroids or tumors, endometriosis or lower jiao stagnation. •  Fallen pillow neck: When treating neck pain, I often cup the neck before needling. However, Double Child/Double Fairy points are particularly good in the treatment of sudden onset neck pain that is worsened by cupping or Tui Na. This situation usually occurs when someone has slept near an open window and contracted a wind chill. (The name, “fallen pillow neck,” refers to the cervical subluxation that suggests a loss of one’s pillow during the night.) •  Neck and back pain: Whereas UB65 Shu Gu with SI3 Hou Xi treats the back, and GB39/77.05-77.07 Three Weights treats the neck, Double Child/Double Fairy covers both. •  Hemiplegia: 22.01 and 22.02 are effective in the treatment of hemiplegia because they are located on the opposite side of the hand from 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai (Spirit Bone/Great White). I use these points for hemiplegia only if there are also respiratory or intestinal indications. See 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) for my comprehensive hemiplegia/stroke protocol. •  Pneumonia, fever, and bronchitis: Double Child/Double Fairy points are effective for pneumonia, fever, and bronchitis because they clear heat and sedate fire due to their proximity to 22.11 Earth Water (LU10), the Ying-Spring point of the Lung. •  Reaction Area of Heart and Lung: 22.02 Double Fairy has the additional Reaction Area of the Heart, which explains its indications of knee pain and palpitations. I do not use Double Fairy specifically for these indications; however, if the upper back and neck are treated with these points, these conditions may also improve. •  Case history (lung cancer, Dr. Lee): “I once treated a woman with late stage lung cancer. Although there was really no hope of keeping her alive, the family wanted me to treat her to reduce the pain. At 6:00 am I went to her house and needled Double Child/Double Fairy. At 5:00 pm after work I returned to see her and she had no pain at all. Two weeks later she died, but her family was grateful that her pain was relieved” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",
        "combinations": "Acute neck sprain: Needle 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy on the opposite side with REN24 Cheng Jiang; usually, one treatment is enough. If the onset is sudden, REN24 Cheng Jiang may be enough. For immediate relief, rotate the neck every 10 minutes while the needles are retained (Active Qi Moving). •  Chronic neck pain: As a substitute for 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons, we can bilaterally needle 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy, adding REN24 as an immediate fix for neck pain. This is typically done only when the Achilles tendon has been compromised. 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy with PC6 Nei Guan is another option. (In classical Chinese medical literature, neck pain is considered a Jue Yin problem.) •  Hand pain: If the patient has difficulty opening and closing the hands, sedate or bleed 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) on the same side, and then needle 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy on the opposite side. For joint pain in the fingers, carpal tunnel syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis, we can also needle SJ5 Wai Guan as part of the Yang Wei Mai. •  Thenar eminence pain: Needle opposite side: 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy, 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, SJ5 Wai Guan and 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), or 22.11 Earth Water. These points are all effective for hand pain. •  Pneumonia, cough, asthma, or lung problems in children: For children five years old or younger, quickly insert and remove the needles at 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy, without retention, or bleed the Si Feng (Extra Points). These kids may also need upper back cupping, Shoni-shin Japanese pediatric techniques, and/or spinal roll (starting at the bottom, roll the skin up the spine). Children older than five years can retain needles (with a good storybook); with them, I may use 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three or Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles. Kids of all ages can be cupped, slowly and carefully; the practitioner must adjust the pressure to olerance.",

        "comments": "Reaction Areas: Shang Bai relates to the wood element via its Reaction Area (Liver) and its location between the Large Intestine and Pericardium channels, both of which share connections to the Liver: Hand Yang Ming (LI) shares a special relationship with Foot Jue Yin (LV), and Hand Jue Yin (PC) is connected with Foot Jue Yin (LV). Thus, Shang Bai acts as a wood Shu-Stream point that treats heaviness of the joints. The Reaction Area (Heart) and the special relationship between Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST) explain the indications for stomach pain and also chest pain due 89 Hand Points to angina.

Energetic pathways: Fen Bai is located opposite 22.01 Double Child, while Ling Gu is located opposite 22.02 Double Fairy. For each set of opposites, the power of the points is enhanced when they are connected through deep needling of either point.

        "techniques": "Bleed the point or nearby veins for respiratory disorders (asthma, fever, pneumonia). Needle perpendicularly 0.5 - 1 cun along the bone. Needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Needling instruction: Da Bai is usually needled opposite the affected side, toward PC8 Lao Gong. The needle is wrapped around the second metacarpal bone in order to obtain an extra bone-treating-bone Kidney function. For sciatica, use a 1.0 to 1.5 cun needle; for other conditions, 1.0 cun is adequate. The point can also be needled perpendicularly. Bleeding: Da Bai can be bled; however, I have had unfavorable experiences (hematoma) when bleeding this point, so I prefer to needle it. Upper back points are easily bled for high fever, pneumonia, and childhood asthma. Depth: 0.5-1.5 cun",
        "comments": "Cautions: • Raises blood pressure. Dao Ma combination: Da Bai (Great White) is occasionally needled on its own, but is more commonly used in combination, with 22.05 Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) as the Chief Point and Da Bai as the Supporting Point. Often in Master Tung’s Dao Ma patterns, one point is supporting the other, but what makes this combination unique is that both Ling Gu and Da Bai, when used individually, are Chief Points. They are needled together primarily to treat a wide variety of diseases by tonifying the qi and warming the yang.10 Energetic pathways: Metal: White is the color of metal, indicating a connection to the metal element (Lung/Large Intestine). All “Bai/White” points (e.g., Da Bai, Shang Bai, Ci Bai, Zhong Bai, Xia Bai) treat the ears, eyes, nose and throat, as well as facial disorders. Da Bai (Great White) is also used in the treatment of high fever, bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema, asthma, and headache due to common cold, for several reasons: it is located on the Large Intestine channel, which shares an internal/ external connection to the Lung; it has the Reaction Area of the Lung; and it is found in the upper jiao portion of the hand. Water: Acting as LI3 San Jian, Da Bai shares similar indications. Because Da Bai is needled closer to the bone – adding a bone-treating-bone, Kidney-tonifying function – it is superior to LI3 San Jian in the treatment of many Kidney-related diseases, such as lower back pain, sciatica, and weakness of the legs. Wood: Da Bai shares the energetic effects of LI3 San Jian, the Shu-Stream and wood point of the Hand Yang Ming, so both points treat wind in the Lung channel; however, Da Bai is much more powerful than LI3. Because the Hand Yang Ming (LI) meridian shares a special relationship with Foot Jue Yin (LV), Da Bai is effective for both internal and external wind conditions. Purplish vein near Da Bai in children: If there is a purplish vein in the area of Da Bai extending into the first phalange, always bleed it. This may appear with high fever, asthma or pneumonia; however, a dark vein here indicates a constitutional pathology of some kind. Bleeding LU11 Shao Shang and LI1 Shang Yang may be substituted when treating wind-heat conditions, though needling these points is more painful. See 22.05 Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) for additional commentary.",
        "combinations": "Common cold with headache: 22.04 Da Bai, A.04 San Cha Three. Sciatica (UB, GB, SP and ST): 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. Groin pain: 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, 33.12 Heart Gate. Tennis elbow: 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. Dizziness: 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. Facial twitch: This is common after Bell’s palsy or excessive stress. Use 22.04 Da Bai, 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles. Trigeminal neuralgia: The middle branch of the trigeminal nerve is the most commonly affected area and can be difficult to resolve. Use 22.04 Da Bai and SI3 Hou Xi, because SI3 links to SI18 Quan Liao and the middle branch of the trigeminal nerve, while 22.04 Da Bai goes to the Yang Ming area (LI/ST) – the middle and lower branches of the nerve. Stimulate one needle on each side, or use all four for a stronger treatment, while the patient simultaneously moves their face (Active Qi Moving). Also consider 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/ Four Flower Middle. 10 When 22.04 Da Bai is combined with 22.05 Ling Gu, I always refer to this combination as “22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai.” Ling Gu as the Chief Point is listed first, even though the point numbering is reversed. Shao Yang branch: Use A.04 San Cha Three or 22.06 Zhong Bai to treat the upper branch of the trigeminal nerve, as Shao Yang relates to the side of the face. Additionally, for Shao Yang-type trigeminal neuralgia, use 77.05-77.07 Three Weights, 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles (or 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop though less effective), adding 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan) for chronic cases. You may also bleed the Tai Yang area, being careful to avoid the artery. Herbs: Trigeminal neuralgia can be excruciatingly painful and may require narcotics. Wu Gong (centipede), Quan Xie (scorpion) and Jiang Can (silk worm) are all very useful in relieving severe pain due to wind, restoring normal flow of qi in all channels and collaterals, neutralizing toxins and dispersing nodules. Extremely small doses of each are used. 1.5 qian Quan Xie (scorpion) can be added to San Pien Tang in cases of unbearable pain.11 Insomnia: 22.04 Da Bai, 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2); this treatment is also known as Anxiety Four Gates or Fire Four Gates.

Consider LI4/LV3 Four Gates. Spinal pain: 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. Consider bleeding UB40 Wei Zhong. Ischial nerve pain: 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. 11 Amounts indicated are for loose herbs measured in qian (1 qian = 3 grams)",

        "techniques": "Cautions: Forbidden to needle during pregnancy. Needle perpendicularly 1 - 1.5 cun . Patient should move his/her back while needles are being manipulated. Needle contralateral to the affected area. Avoid the radial artery when needling. When treating problems involving the bone, needles should be inserted along the edge of the bone or touching the bone for optimal effectiveness. | Johnson: Needling instruction: Ling Gu is needled perpendicularly, as close as possible to the junction of the first and second metacarpal bones. A bone-treating-bone Kidney tonification function is obtained when the needle shaft contacts the bone. Dao Ma: 22.05 Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) is almost always paired with 22.04 Da Bai (Great White). In this combination, Ling Gu is the Chief Point, and Da Bai is the Supporting Point. Depth: 0.5-1.5 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) is located on the Large Intestine meridian, anatomically between LU9 Tai Yuan (LU Yuan-Source/Shu-Stream point) and LI4 He Gu (LI Yuan-Source point). Ling Gu and Da Bai excel at tonifying qi deficiency anywhere in the body, primarily due to their location on either side of He Gu, a major Yuan-Source point. Da Bai links to the upper jiao, He Gu relates to the middle jiao, and Ling Gu relates to the lower jiao; therefore, indications are connected to all three jiao. The combination of Ling Gu/Da Bai nourishes and warms the yang, powerfully tonifies qi, and can be used to treat indications such as exhaustion, chronic cough or frequent urination due to yang deficiency. As explained below, Ling Gu and Da Bai regulate metal and water as well as wood and fire, and are internally/externally connected to the earth element (LI/ST), tonifying Stomach qi to treat insufficient digestion. The combination of these energetics makes Ling Gu and Da Bai among the most powerful acupuncture points on the entire body. Harmonizing metal and water: Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) and Da Bai (Great White) represent the relationship between descending Lung qi and receiving Kidney qi. Da Bai is in the upper jiao area of the hand, representing the Lung, while Ling Gu is in the lower jiao area of the hand, representing the Kidneys. Lung and Kidney nourish the yin, regulate fluids and tonify qi. By harmonizing metal and water, they regulate breathing. When the Lung qi is not descending, people pant; if the Kidney qi is not properly receiving, breathing is long and labored. Large Intestine and Lung are externally/internally related, and Ling Gu and Da Bai both share the Reaction Area of the Lungs. Additionally, Ling Gu is located opposite 22.02 Double Fairy; deep needling of either point connects them to each other and enhances their potency. Double Fairy relates to Lung and treats pain of the upper back and scapula along the UB channel because it utilizes the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB). It is because both Lung and Urinary Bladder disperse fluids, and Large Intestine and Lung are connected, that Ling Gu and Da Bai are useful in the treatment of frequent or painful urination. This same relationship (LI/LU/UB) accounts for the points’ extraordinary usefulness in the treatment of Urinary Bladder sciatica. Sciatica: Whether the sciatica is along the Urinary Bladder, Gallbladder, Spleen or Stomach channel, or a combination of these, Ling Gu and Da Bai can treat it. The special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB), explained above, is one reason for these points’ unparalleled ability to strengthen the leg. Seventy percent of sciatica cases seen in the clinic are found along the Urinary Bladder channel and are related to the disc between the fifth lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum; twenty percent are connected to the L4-L5 disc and reflect on the Gallbladder channel. The remaining ten percent are L3-L4 disc related, affecting the Spleen or Stomach channel. If more than one disc is compromised, sciatica affects multiple channels. Ling Gu and Da Bai are the only Dao Ma combination found in Tung’s acupuncture that is capable of addressing all channels simultaneously. Energetic connections related to sciatica include: In TCM, the Kidney is said to govern the lower back and legs. Through the five-element relationship of metal (LU) as the mother of water (KD), the Lung and Kidney are connected. The points also strengthen the lower back due to the LU/UB special relationship (described above), as well as the internal/external relationship between the Kidney and Urinary Bladder, and the points’ Kidney tonification function that is activated when the needles contact the bone. Among these Kidney connections, an extremely important one is the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD). Many patients experience sciatica that is primarily along the Gallbladder channel or is a combination of Urinary and Gallbladder types. Because Hand Shao Yang and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB) share a pathway, this powerful relationship between Shao Yang and Shao Yin (SJ/KD) enables Ling Gu and Da Bai to treat both channels. Additionally, imaging systems reveal a correspondence between the fingers and the hips. There are further connections to lower back and Kidney: Ling Gu is located on the lower jiao segment of the hand, and the Kidney and Large Intestine channels are opposites on the Chinese clock (horary). Because Yang Ming (LI/ST) and Tai Yin (LU/SP) both connect to the earth element, Ling Gu and Da Bai are also effective in the treatment of sciatica along the Spleen or Stomach channel. Case histories (sciatica): Sciatica due to lung cancer (Dr. Lee): I remember a particular case in Dr. Lee’s clinic in which UB channel sciatica resolved quickly but returned the following day. This made Dr. Lee suspect a lung condition, so she ordered a chest X-ray that identified the patient’s lung cancer. Lung weakness may show up on the Urinary Bladder channel as either sciatica or scapular pain. Sciatica patient testing his “fix”: A patient in my practice was a heavy smoker with sciatica. After I needled Ling Gu and Da Bai, his sciatic pain completely disappeared. He went home and bench pressed to test the strength of his lower back after the treatment, as patients sometimes do. The pain immediately returned and was more severe than before, and I was not able to affect it with a second treatment the following day. It is best not to suggest to patients the possibility of cancer; however, I asked him to get a chest X-ray as soon as possible. Unfortunately, he never came back. It is always a good idea to remind patients to rest after their treatments. Regulating wood and fire: Points such as Ling Gu and Da Bai, which treat earth, metal and water simultaneously, are the best points for tonifying qi. When there is blood deficiency, the yin and fluids are also weak. When there is yang deficiency, qi and fire are lacking. Da Bai (Tung’s LI3), which is activated by LI4 He Gu (Source Point) and is a wood Shu point, strongly relates to wood. Ling Gu, also activated by He Gu and LI5 Yang Xi (fire point), relates to fire. Together, they tonify qi, generating wood to build fire and thus warming the yang. By tonifying qi and warming the yang, these points are able to build the blood. Because the Yang Ming channel has more qi and more blood, Ling Gu and Da Bai are not only tonifying but also regulating for the qi and blood, and they can be very useful in the treatment of muscle atrophy and hemiplegia as well as digestive weakness, poor appetite, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, and stomach or anal prolapse. Wood/wind/tendon diseases: Because the Hand Yang Ming (LI) meridian shares a special relationship with the Foot Jue Yin (LV), Ling Gu and Da Bai are effective in the treatment of wood, wind and tendon diseases, such as: migraines; tinnitus; dizziness; hemiplegia; facial paralysis; shoulder pain; tennis elbow; pain in the hip, groin, knee or heel; and urinary or menstrual disorders. Brain connections: Through the special relationship of Large Intestine and Liver, Ling Gu and Da Bai connect with the brain. When combined with LV2 or LV3 and/or 11.17 Wood (Anger), they can be used for confused mental states, anxiety, depression or internalized rage. We find that classic, earth-type Four Gates LI4 He Gu with LV3 Tai Chong (22.05 Ling Gu/66.04 Fire Master, which is Tung’s LV3) and alternatively, fire- type Anxiety Four Gates (22.04 Da Bai with 66.03 Fire Hardness, which is Tung’s LV2), all derive their strength from the main Source points and strongest qi points of the Liver and Large Intestine channels.",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: The primary function of the Middle White/Lower White (Zhong Bai/Xia Bai) combination is a result of the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD), which makes for strong Kidney tonification. For this reason, the points are exceptionally effective in the treatment of Gallbladder channel sciatica and lower leg pain. Due to this connection, these points are also effective for nephritis, edema, exhaustion, spine pain, bone spurs, astigmatism, tinnitus and irritation at the roots of the teeth. Because there are so many San Jiao and Gallbladder points located on the sides of the head, 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai are especially good for clearing stagnation and bringing clear qi to the head. Similar to GB31, they treat Shao Yang wind issues, such as headache, migraine, mania, hypertension, Meniere’s disease, dizziness and vertigo. This is because of the Hand and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB) relationship, as well as the San Jiao/Pericardium/Liver/Gallbladder connections. Zhong Bai as a Guiding Point: Because of its easy access to the Shao Yang points on the head, Zhong Bai is a terrific Guiding Point for any indications related to the ears, shooting pain in the head, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ or facial paralysis. Sciatica (Gallbladder): Zhong Bai is Tung’s version of SJ3 Zhong Zhu, the Shu-Stream point, so it treats heaviness and pain along the Shao Yang (SJ/GB) meridian, tonifying the qi of the San Jiao. It shares the same connection to the Kidney, and passes through the same area, as A.04 San Cha Three. Both of these points have a very powerful effect on sciatica as well as exhaustion from Kidney deficiency. Treatment: When treating Gallbladder channel sciatica, I usually combine Zhong Bai and Xia Bai with 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai. Of diagnostic interest, Gallbladder channel sciatica is especially characterized by pain when getting up from sitting. See 22.05 Ling Gu for comprehensive commentary on sciatica. Pain around the navel: SI3 Hou Xi (22.08 Wrist Prosperous One) with LI10 Shou San Li or LI11 Qu Chi treats pain around the navel. However, 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai are better than SI3 because they function like GB41 Lin Qi in tonifying the Kidney, and they open the Dai Mai to treat pain stuck in the waist and lower back. Pain behind the heart: Middle White/Lower White can be used like 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) and also UB60 Kun Lun (or all of them together) to treat palpitations, anxiety and pain behind the heart, due to the internal/external connection between the San Jiao and Pericardium (Heart Protector) and also the following energetic pathways and special relationships: SJ-PC-LV-GB-HT-KD-SJ.",

Needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Needling instruction: SI3 Hou Xi is needled much like 22.04 Da Bai, but is located on the opposite side of the hand. Wrap the needle around the fifth metacarpal bone just beneath the distal head, using a curving needle technique. You may needle at the crease found just proximal to the fifth metacarpal-phalangeal joint, since the skin of the crease is desensitized. I insert the needle as close as possible to the junction of red and white skin and the shaft of the metacarpal bone. Hand positioning: Bend the patient’s elbow and rest their loosely closed fist against their chest. This is the most comfortable needling position for the practitioner and the patient, and it allows for easier needling alongside the bone. Dao Ma: For weak patients, needle either Wrist Prosperous One or Wrist Prosperous Two but not both. Needle both points if the patient is strong. Depth: Shallow insertion (0.5 cun; heaven level) treats the shoulder, while deeper insertion (1.0 cun) goes to the lower back. Insertion to a depth of 1.5 cun treats the lower leg, sciatica, or the back of the knee.",
        "comments": "Similar in function to SI3 Hou Xi: 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One and 22.09 Wrist Prosperous Two are acting as Master Tung’s version of SI3 Back Ravine. The name “Back Ravine” refers to the vertebral column. Wrist Prosperous One and Two can be used together, but in most circumstances I use SI3 Hou Xi instead, and call it Wrist Prosperous One. The classical point Hou Xi is one of my very favorite points because it powerfully opens the spine, is the Master point of the Du Mai, and is the Shu-Stream point of the Hand Tai Yang channel. Some of the classical attributes of SI3 include: alleviating pain by activating the channel; clearing wind and heat; calming the spirit; regulating the Du Mai; benefiting the entire back and neck; reviving consciousness and opening the orifices; treating disorders of the head and senses, including tinnitus and deafness, mania and psychosis, epilepsy, and stroke; febrile diseases; jaundice; and malaria. Energetic pathways: The power of SI3 Hou Xi has to do with the connection between the Hand Tai Yang and Foot Tai Yang (SI/UB) and the internal/external relationship between the Urinary Bladder and Kidney. When the needle is curved under the bone, it activates an additional bone-treating-bone, Kidney tonification function. Deep needling of this point connects to 22.06 Zhong Bai (Tung’s SJ3), activating the special relationship between the San Jiao and Kidney (Hand Tai Yang/Foot Tai Yin). Because the Small Intestine has an internal/external connection with the Heart, and the Hand Shao Yin and Foot Shao Yin (HT/KD) share a pathway, all of the above-listed connections explain this point’s abundant Kidney-deficiency indications. SI3 is a good Guiding Point for frozen shoulder because of the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yang (SI) and the Foot Tai Yin (SP), as well as the connection of Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP). By utilizing the relationship between the Small Intestine and Spleen (treating the back of the shoulder, SI9-SI10), we can access the front of the shoulder, which relates to Lung and Spleen. Remember that SI3 is a very powerful wood Shu-Stream point, used for heaviness and pain because it drains wind (wood) and damp (earth). In Tung’s system, Urinary Bladder channel sciatica is often referred to as “Lung-deficient sciatica” due to the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB) channels, as well as the relationship between Hand Tai Yang and Foot Tai Yang (SI/UB). Because of these connections, SI3 Hou Xi is one of the best points for opening the spine, and it serves as a good starting place in the treatment of Urinary Bladder channel sciatica. Sciatica (Urinary Bladder channel): SI3 Back Ravine opens the spine. In combination with 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, it has an amazing effect in the treatment of opposite- side UB channel sciatica or any pain of the opposite thigh. UB65 Shu Gu, Bone Association Point, is added as an excellent Guiding Point to pull the qi into the affected leg. In severe cases, I may also needle 1010.22 Nose Wing or bleed DT.08 Essence Branch. SI3 is uniquely effective for pain in the back of the knee, swelling, or sciatica. Bone spur protocol (Dr. Young): Dr. Young taught me a powerful protocol for treating all bone spurs, and I use it regularly in my clinic: bilaterally needle SI3 Hou Xi, UB65 Shu Gu, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), and DU26 Ren Zhong, all of which treat tendon and bone. If the spurs are cervical, substitute REN24 Cheng Jiang for DU26 Ren Zhong in every other treatment when using this protocol, as REN24 Cheng Jiang is specific for cervical vertebrae. Both points are extremely painful, so needle to gently tap the bone and do not stimulate the point. Before needling either point, inform the patient that their eyes will water. Due to the sensitivity of these two points, it may be necessary to alternate the bone spur treatment protocol with other point patterns, such as 77.05-77.07 Three Weights (Tung’s GB39), to be sensitive to the patient and avoid their anticipation of pain. 119 Hand Points UB40: The most powerful treatment for bone spurs, especially along the spine, is the bleeding of UB40 Wei Zhong every two weeks. This clears stagnation and increases circulation by removing “dirty” blood and stimulating the production of new, freshly oxygenated blood cells in the bone marrow. Energetic pathways: We use SI3 Hou Xi because it is the Master point of the Du Mai and has the tremendous effect of opening the spine. UB65 Shu Gu, Bone Association Point, activates the Urinary Bladder channel, relaxes sinews, alleviates pain, clears heat, expels wind, and is good for inflammation. It is the wood Shu- Stream point on the Urinary Bladder channel and, as its name implies, is useful in treating bone. 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) expels wind and damp, activates the channel and alleviates pain. Because the Shao Yang channel controls bone, and GB31 Wind Market disperses wind, this point has much to do with the circulation of channels and collaterals and is specific to bone spurs. Likewise, DU26 Ren Zhong is specifically used for bone spurs; it clears the senses, cools heat, calms the spirit and benefits the spine, especially the lumbar spine. It is also the point at which the Yang Ming channel (LI/ST) intersects with the Du Mai. Inflammation: Bone spur pain comes from the surrounding soft tissue inflammation pressing on the nerve, and not from the spur itself, unless the spur is biting into the spinal cord. To make sure the inflammation does not return, it is essential to continue treatment with a formula for soft tissue inflammation after the pain is gone. If the bone spurs are severe, treat the patient three times per week. The spurs may not go away, but the pain should dissipate. Treatment for bone spurs takes at least 6-8 weeks if the spurs are located on the lumbar or cervical spine. If treatment does not resolve the pain, which can be severe, an MRI is required. It is essential that the patient rest! Diet is also crucial; the patient must avoid any kind of inflammatory food. Emulsified turmeric, Omega-3 fish oils, and boswellia supplements may also be helpful. Three Yellows: 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows or just 88.12 Bright Yellow (exactly opposite GB31) can also be used for bone spurs; add 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Middle/Lower if the spurs are found on the knee or heel. See 77.08 Four Flower Middle for other points that can be used for knee and heel spurs. Kidney deficiency/diagnostics: Wrist Prosperous tonifies the Kidneys and is used for many types of Kidney-deficient diseases, such as nephritis, exhaustion, dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, swollen joints, headaches, and pain of the whole back and spine. If the side of the hand, including and below SI3, is thin, the patient may have had trouble with nephritis as a child. If it is soft and there are veins in this area, the patient may have a history of asthma. Medial elbow pain: For golfer’s elbow, needle opposite-side 33.12 Heart Gate with same-side SI3 Hou Xi, because SI3 is a great Guiding Point for any Small Intestine channel issues affecting the wrist, forearm, elbow, scapula or neck. Tinnitus or deafness: Combine SI3 with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, because the Small Intestine channel ends at SI19 Ting Gong, Listening Palace, just in front of the ear opening.",

Needle contralateral to the affected side or bilaterally. | Johnson: Needling instruction: SI3 Hou Xi is needled much like 22.04 Da Bai, but is located on the opposite side of the hand. Wrap the needle around the fifth metacarpal bone just beneath the distal head, using a curving needle technique. You may needle at the crease found just proximal to the fifth metacarpal-phalangeal joint, since the skin of the crease is desensitized. I insert the needle as close as possible to the junction of red and white skin and the shaft of the metacarpal bone. Hand positioning: Bend the patient’s elbow and rest their loosely closed fist against their chest. This is the most comfortable needling position for the practitioner and the patient, and it allows for easier needling alongside the bone. Dao Ma: For weak patients, needle either Wrist Prosperous One or Wrist Prosperous Two but not both. Needle both points if the patient is strong. Depth: Shallow insertion (0.5 cun; heaven level) treats the shoulder, while deeper insertion (1.0 cun) goes to the lower back. Insertion to a depth of 1.5 cun treats the lower leg, sciatica, or the back of the knee.",
        "comments": "Similar in function to SI3 Hou Xi: 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One and 22.09 Wrist Prosperous Two are acting as Master Tung’s version of SI3 Back Ravine. The name “Back Ravine” refers to the vertebral column. Wrist Prosperous One and Two can be used together, but in most circumstances I use SI3 Hou Xi instead, and call it Wrist Prosperous One. The classical point Hou Xi is one of my very favorite points because it powerfully opens the spine, is the Master point of the Du Mai, and is the Shu-Stream point of the Hand Tai Yang channel. Some of the classical attributes of SI3 include: alleviating pain by activating the channel; clearing wind and heat; calming the spirit; regulating the Du Mai; benefiting the entire back and neck; reviving consciousness and opening the orifices; treating disorders of the head and senses, including tinnitus and deafness, mania and psychosis, epilepsy, and stroke; febrile diseases; jaundice; and malaria. Energetic pathways: The power of SI3 Hou Xi has to do with the connection between the Hand Tai Yang and Foot Tai Yang (SI/UB) and the internal/external relationship between the Urinary Bladder and Kidney. When the needle is curved under the bone, it activates an additional bone-treating-bone, Kidney tonification function. Deep needling of this point connects to 22.06 Zhong Bai (Tung’s SJ3), activating the special relationship between the San Jiao and Kidney (Hand Tai Yang/Foot Tai Yin). Because the Small Intestine has an internal/external connection with the Heart, and the Hand Shao Yin and Foot Shao Yin (HT/KD) share a pathway, all of the above-listed connections explain this point’s abundant Kidney-deficiency indications. SI3 is a good Guiding Point for frozen shoulder because of the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yang (SI) and the Foot Tai Yin (SP), as well as the connection of Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP). By utilizing the relationship between the Small Intestine and Spleen (treating the back of the shoulder, SI9-SI10), we can access the front of the shoulder, which relates to Lung and Spleen. Remember that SI3 is a very powerful wood Shu-Stream point, used for heaviness and pain because it drains wind (wood) and damp (earth). In Tung’s system, Urinary Bladder channel sciatica is often referred to as “Lung-deficient sciatica” due to the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB) channels, as well as the relationship between Hand Tai Yang and Foot Tai Yang (SI/UB). Because of these connections, SI3 Hou Xi is one of the best points for opening the spine, and it serves as a good starting place in the treatment of Urinary Bladder channel sciatica. Sciatica (Urinary Bladder channel): SI3 Back Ravine opens the spine. In combination with 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, it has an amazing effect in the treatment of opposite- side UB channel sciatica or any pain of the opposite thigh. UB65 Shu Gu, Bone Association Point, is added as an excellent Guiding Point to pull the qi into the affected leg. In severe cases, I may also needle 1010.22 Nose Wing or bleed DT.08 Essence Branch. SI3 is uniquely effective for pain in the back of the knee, swelling, or sciatica. Bone spur protocol (Dr. Young): Dr. Young taught me a powerful protocol for treating all bone spurs, and I use it regularly in my clinic: bilaterally needle SI3 Hou Xi, UB65 Shu Gu, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), and DU26 Ren Zhong, all of which treat tendon and bone. If the spurs are cervical, substitute REN24 Cheng Jiang for DU26 Ren Zhong in every other treatment when using this protocol, as REN24 Cheng Jiang is specific for cervical vertebrae. Both points are extremely painful, so needle to gently tap the bone and do not stimulate the point. Before needling either point, inform the patient that their eyes will water. Due to the sensitivity of these two points, it may be necessary to alternate the bone spur treatment protocol with other point patterns, such as 77.05-77.07 Three Weights (Tung’s GB39), to be sensitive to the patient and avoid their anticipation of pain. 119 Hand Points UB40: The most powerful treatment for bone spurs, especially along the spine, is the bleeding of UB40 Wei Zhong every two weeks. This clears stagnation and increases circulation by removing “dirty” blood and stimulating the production of new, freshly oxygenated blood cells in the bone marrow. Energetic pathways: We use SI3 Hou Xi because it is the Master point of the Du Mai and has the tremendous effect of opening the spine. UB65 Shu Gu, Bone Association Point, activates the Urinary Bladder channel, relaxes sinews, alleviates pain, clears heat, expels wind, and is good for inflammation. It is the wood Shu- Stream point on the Urinary Bladder channel and, as its name implies, is useful in treating bone. 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) expels wind and damp, activates the channel and alleviates pain. Because the Shao Yang channel controls bone, and GB31 Wind Market disperses wind, this point has much to do with the circulation of channels and collaterals and is specific to bone spurs. Likewise, DU26 Ren Zhong is specifically used for bone spurs; it clears the senses, cools heat, calms the spirit and benefits the spine, especially the lumbar spine. It is also the point at which the Yang Ming channel (LI/ST) intersects with the Du Mai. Inflammation: Bone spur pain comes from the surrounding soft tissue inflammation pressing on the nerve, and not from the spur itself, unless the spur is biting into the spinal cord. To make sure the inflammation does not return, it is essential to continue treatment with a formula for soft tissue inflammation after the pain is gone. If the bone spurs are severe, treat the patient three times per week. The spurs may not go away, but the pain should dissipate. Treatment for bone spurs takes at least 6-8 weeks if the spurs are located on the lumbar or cervical spine. If treatment does not resolve the pain, which can be severe, an MRI is required. It is essential that the patient rest! Diet is also crucial; the patient must avoid any kind of inflammatory food. Emulsified turmeric, Omega-3 fish oils, and boswellia supplements may also be helpful. Three Yellows: 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows or just 88.12 Bright Yellow (exactly opposite GB31) can also be used for bone spurs; add 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Middle/Lower if the spurs are found on the knee or heel. See 77.08 Four Flower Middle for other points that can be used for knee and heel spurs. Kidney deficiency/diagnostics: Wrist Prosperous tonifies the Kidneys and is used for many types of Kidney-deficient diseases, such as nephritis, exhaustion, dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, swollen joints, headaches, and pain of the whole back and spine. If the side of the hand, including and below SI3, is thin, the patient may have had trouble with nephritis as a child. If it is soft and there are veins in this area, the patient may have a history of asthma. Medial elbow pain: For golfer’s elbow, needle opposite-side 33.12 Heart Gate with same-side SI3 Hou Xi, because SI3 is a great Guiding Point for any Small Intestine channel issues affecting the wrist, forearm, elbow, scapula or neck. Tinnitus or deafness: Combine SI3 with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, because the Small Intestine channel ends at SI19 Ting Gong, Listening Palace, just in front of the ear opening.",
        "combinations": "Back pain: Needle opposite-side or bilateral SI3 Hou Xi, UB65 Shu Gu on the same side as a Guiding Point. For spine pain or muscle spasm on both sides of the spine, use both points bilaterally with strong stimulation.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Hand Release is the Ying-Spring fire point on a fire channel; it warms the yang and strengthens the Heart. Ying-Spring points are related to a change in face color (such as sudden red, white or green face coloration) from trauma or needling. The Heart controls the shen and zhi (will/intent), and most Heart channel points treat states of consciousness. The classics say, “All pain comes from the Heart.” Hand Release is useful for recovery from painful needling (hyperdermic or acupuncture) and swelling or pain from injuries. Dr. Lee found it useful for women who bled easily or who had excessive pain due to the use of hormone replacement therapy. Itching: Itching relates to the Heart. It causes the skin to change color and creates irritability, causing more itching. Hand Release calms itching as soon as it is needled because it is a Ying-Spring point that reduces fire, redness and heat. Itching is due to both wind and fire fighting, and qi and blood fighting. The treatment principle is to disperse wind, reduce fire and vitalize the blood. Some skin diseases, such as psoriasis, are more common in wealthy cultures due to rich foods, environmental toxins, pet allergens, etc. To treat itchy skin and rashes, I bleed 99.08 Ear Apex, cup DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, and needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three. 88.28 Release (Tung’s ST34): Similar to Hand Release, 88.28 is also used for disturbance in the flow of qi and blood, swelling and pain from needling or traumatic injury, and extreme fatigue. 88.28 is found on the Stomach channel, just below classic ST34 Liang Qiu.

        "comments": "Lung channel: The Lung channel originates in the middle jiao, in the region of the Stomach, and then travels downward to the Large Intestine. From there it ascends close to the cardiac sphincter, crosses the diaphragm, enters the lungs and connects to the Stomach and Kidney channels via the Chong Mai. The primary channel then emerges at LU1 Zhong Fu and descends along the arm, lateral to the Heart and Pericardium channels. Energetic pathways: Tung’s LU10 are the three points included in Tu Shui/Earth Water; they have the Reaction Areas of the Spleen and Kidney, indicating the connection to earth (Spleen/Stomach) and water (Kidney/Urinary Bladder). As Lung and Large Intestine are both metal, Earth Water therefore relates to metal, earth and water, treating diseases of the Lung, Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine and Kidney. Textbook LU10 Yu Ji descends Lung qi, relieves sore throat, clears Lung heat, descends rebellious qi, and harmonizes the Stomach and Heart. Likewise, Earth Water tonifies and regulates qi and is very effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal and lung conditions (especially asthma). Its efficacy is due to the internal/external relationship between Lung and Large Intestine, which is strengthened by the Hand and Foot Tai Yin relationship (LU/SP) and the Hand and Foot Yang Ming relationship (LI/ST). Hand Tai Yin (LU) shares a special relationship with Foot Tai Yang (UB), and both of them diffuse water; this further explains the use of Earth Water in draining dampness. Gastroenteritis: The middle point (metal) of the three-point Earth Water is textbook LU10 Yu Ji, the Chief Point in this pattern, and it can be used to treat acute stomachache. The distal point (earth) represents the Spleen and Stomach, and it is a Supporting Point that treats qi deficiency. The proximal point (water) represents cold and Kidney, and it is a Supporting Point that treats diarrhea. Earth Water therefore effectively drains cold or hot dampness, including damp heat from the Stomach, via the intestines and urinary bladder. Sore throat: Because the Chief Point of Earth Water overlaps LU10 Yu Ji, the fire Ying- Spring point, it is effective in the treatment of sore throat due to external pathogenic wind heat. Asthma: LU10 can stop wheezing immediately, especially when it is bled. Because the thenar eminence has a large supply of nerves and blood, bleeding veins in this area is excellent for asthma, emphysema or pneumonia. However, this is painful, and puncturing the area too deeply can create lingering pain and bruising. For that reason, I use a spring-loaded lancet and bleed only when absolutely necessary. Good alternatives are to bleed or needle 33.16 Curve Mound (Tung’s LU5), or to cup (and/or bleed) points on the upper back. If a patient comes to you in an emergency asthmatic condition, on their way to the hospital to get on a respirator, you can buy time by cupping Ding Chuan (Extra Point) and bleeding LU5, then follow with additional treatment for asthma. This may allow the patient to avoid the emergency room. Diagnostic veins: According to the Huangdi Neijing, the area of the thenar eminence can help diagnose gastric and intestinal disorders (Dr. Carson, 1988). If the thenar eminence is a blue or green color, it indicates Stomach cold (excess water in the earth), while red color indicates Stomach heat. This area is often red when there is constipation, or green when there is acute diarrhea or loose stool from cold; it may have blue swollen veins if there is enteritis or severe diarrhea (Dr. Young). A plethora of veins located in the lower third of the thenar eminence is often diagnostic of uterine fibroids, cysts or tumors. Thirty percent of women over 30 years of age have fibroids. If a patient has many veins in this area, ask her if she has frequent urination or lower back pain during menses, indicative of a tipped uterus due to fibroids. Metacarpal thumb pain: Though less effective than 22.01-22.02 Double Child/Double Fairy, Earth Water is used to treat hand pain, especially due to injury, when needled on the opposite side. 22.11 is a good option specifically for metacarpal thumb pain, as 11.27.1-2 Five Tigers and 66.01 Seal are only effective when treating the phalangeal joints of the thumb.",

It is said that perpendicular needling yields no therapeutic effect. | Johnson: Dao Ma: This Door, This Corner, and This Uprightness are needled together, unilaterally. I usually needle them on the left side, though needling them on the right side is allowed. Positioning and needling: Locate the points on the Large Intestine channel, with the patient’s forearm across their chest. Pinch up the skin and horizontally thread 30mm needles in one of two directions (see below). Insert the needle 1 mm under the epidermis and on top of the muscle. Then, flattening the shaft of the needle against the skin to use it as a guide, keep the needle superficial as you insert it. After initial insertion, when you flatten the shaft against the skin, if you see a slight “pucker” of skin in front of the tip of the needle, back the needle out slightly so that the skin flattens out and the pucker disappears, then proceed with inserting superficially between the epidermis and the muscle beneath. Due to the many veins in this area that may cause the needles to skew, you will likely need to slightly reposition the needles to correct their trajectory once they are inserted, aligning them as if on a line drawn between LI4 and LI11. If the needles are inserted correctly, the patient should be able to comfortably and fully rotate their forearm. Pain with rotation of the arm usually implies that the insertion is too deep. Tonification vs. sedation: In cases of deficiency (more common than excess conditions), tonify the points by needling toward the elbow with the flow of the Large Intestine channel. If there is an excess condition, sedate the points by needling toward the wrist. Depth: Thread the needles horizontally beneath the skin, 1.0 cun.",
        "comments": "Imaging: This area of the forearm corresponds with the anus and genitals. The point closest to the wrist treats the navel, while the more proximal point treats the anus. I primarily use these points in the treatment of hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and prolapse. They derive their power in part from LI7 Wen Liu, the Xi-Cleft point of the Large Intestine, which is located between This Door and This Corner; Xi-Cleft points regulate qi and blood. I have needled these points in both directions, depending on whether the patient had an excess or deficient condition. If I am treating a hard and dry (excess) constipation, I needle against the meridian, toward the wrist. If I am treating anal 129 Hand Points prolapse, hemorrhoids or bleeding, I thread the needles along the back side of the radius, toward the elbow. Hemorrhoids and constipation: This area of the forearm is useful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. It includes the area of extra point Er Bai (located four cun proximal to PC7 Da Ling on both sides of the tendon) and 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), and it mirrors 77.04 Catching Ball (UB57). All three of these are used to treat constipation and hemorrhoids. Bleeding UB40: Even more effective for hemorrhoids is the bleeding of UB40 Wei Zhong. Hemorrhoids are a form of varicosity, indicating blood stagnation. The bleeding of veins in the popliteal crease clears the stagnant, black (deoxygenated) blood and stimulates the bone marrow to produce fresh, oxygenated blood. In severe cases of constipation and/or hemorrhoids, I bleed two or three veins on the back of each knee. In most cases, very dark blood appears and the hemorrhoids are significantly improved within 24 hours. If there are no obvious veins, do not bleed. Prolapse: Prolapse is thought of as a dropping down or slipping of the qi, and in TCM it relates to the Lung and Kidney. These points, found on the Large Intestine meridian, have an internal/external relationship with the Lung and the Reaction Area of Lung. Because Lung is the mother of Kidney, we can use the analogy of a straw in a glass of water to describe the ability of the Lung to draw qi upwards, strengthening the Kidney.

I usually needle them on the left side, though needling them on the right side is allowed. Positioning and needling: Locate the points on the Large Intestine channel, with the patient’s forearm across their chest. Pinch up the skin and horizontally thread 30mm needles in one of two directions (see below). Insert the needle 1 mm under the epidermis and on top of the muscle. Then, flattening the shaft of the needle against the skin to use it as a guide, keep the needle superficial as you insert it. After initial insertion, when you flatten the shaft against the skin, if you see a slight “pucker” of skin in front of the tip of the needle, back the needle out slightly so that the skin flattens out and the pucker disappears, then proceed with inserting superficially between the epidermis and the muscle beneath. Due to the many veins in this area that may cause the needles to skew, you will likely need to slightly reposition the needles to correct their trajectory once they are inserted, aligning them as if on a line drawn between LI4 and LI11. If the needles are inserted correctly, the patient should be able to comfortably and fully rotate their forearm. Pain with rotation of the arm usually implies that the insertion is too deep. Tonification vs. sedation: In cases of deficiency (more common than excess conditions), tonify the points by needling toward the elbow with the flow of the Large Intestine channel. If there is an excess condition, sedate the points by needling toward the wrist. Depth: Thread the needles horizontally beneath the skin, 1.0 cun.",
        "comments": "Imaging: This area of the forearm corresponds with the anus and genitals. The point closest to the wrist treats the navel, while the more proximal point treats the anus. I primarily use these points in the treatment of hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and prolapse. They derive their power in part from LI7 Wen Liu, the Xi-Cleft point of the Large Intestine, which is located between This Door and This Corner; Xi-Cleft points regulate qi and blood. I have needled these points in both directions, depending on whether the patient had an excess or deficient condition. If I am treating a hard and dry (excess) constipation, I needle against the meridian, toward the wrist. If I am treating anal prolapse, hemorrhoids or bleeding, I thread the needles along the back side of the radius, toward the elbow. Hemorrhoids and constipation: This area of the forearm is useful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. It includes the area of extra point Er Bai (located four cun proximal to PC7 Da Ling on both sides of the tendon) and 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), and it mirrors 77.04 Catching Ball (UB57). All three of these are used to treat constipation and hemorrhoids. Bleeding UB40: Even more effective for hemorrhoids is the bleeding of UB40 Wei Zhong. Hemorrhoids are a form of varicosity, indicating blood stagnation. The bleeding of veins in the popliteal crease clears the stagnant, black (deoxygenated) blood and stimulates the bone marrow to produce fresh, oxygenated blood. In severe cases of constipation and/or hemorrhoids, I bleed two or three veins on the back of each knee. In most cases, very dark blood appears and the hemorrhoids are significantly improved within 24 hours. If there are no obvious veins, do not bleed. Prolapse: Prolapse is thought of as a dropping down or slipping of the qi, and in TCM it relates to the Lung and Kidney. These points, found on the Large Intestine meridian, have an internal/external relationship with the Lung and the Reaction Area of Lung. Because Lung is the mother of Kidney, we can use the analogy of a straw in a glass of water to describe the ability of the Lung to draw qi upwards, strengthening the Kidney. If we cap the top of a straw with our finger and lift it out of the water, the straw remains full. This illustrates the action of strong Lung qi. When we uncap the straw, the water drops out; this can be likened to Lung deficiency causing Kidney weakness (incontinence). If the Lung energy is weak, there may be anal prolapse, menstrual spotting or urinary incontinence. We can use this analogy to understand any kind of prolapse, including hemorrhoids; it is also relevant for uterine bleeding. Additionally, if a laboring mother has a cough due to Lung excess, labor is delayed because the excess is delaying or holding up the descent of the baby. In this case, the treatment principle is to disperse Lung qi to induce labor.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Fire Threaded has the Reaction Area of the Heart and Lung and is a fire point on a fire channel, connecting the San Jiao and Pericardium meridians. Indications for these points relate to both Liver and Kidney due to the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD), the San Jiao and Pericardium (internal/external), and the Liver through the Hand and Foot Jue Yin (PC/LV). Fire element: This point is located at SJ6 Zhi Gou (the fire point on a fire meridian). “Huo” in the point name translates as “fire,” indicating the internal/external connection between the San Jiao and Pericardium. “Chuan” in the name may be translated as “stringing together” (Dr. Carson) or “threaded” (Dr. Young), referring to the fact that we needle from SJ6 through to the Pericardium meridian, thereby affecting the chest and heart. Constipation: Fire Threaded is primarily used for constipation because it regulates qi and controls fire. 66.13 Water Crystal (Tung’s KD6) can be added; together they regulate qi and tonify fluids. Dao Ma: Fire Threaded is often combined with 33.05 Fire Mound and 33.06 Fire Mountain to treat chest pain or spasm of the hand or forearm. These are very powerful points, so needle them on one side only – either on the same side as the chest pain, or on the right side for women and the left side for men. Lower back and waist: Fire Threaded treats acute muscular strain of the waist or low back, due to the special connection between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD). Shao Yang pain: Due to the internal/external connection between the Hand and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB), this point treats sprained ankle and stiff neck, though I would more likely choose A.05 Small Joint for ankle sprain and 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles for Shao Yang neck pain. If Fire Threaded is used for other reasons and the ankle or neck responds, it is because of the Shao Yang connection.

Generally, I needle 33.04 Fire Threaded, 33.05 Fire Mound and 33.06 Fire Mountain together, especially for cramping chest spasm or severe chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath. This chest pain is not true angina; instead, it is more muscular in nature. Hand or forearm cramping: Fire Threaded, Fire Mound and Fire Mountain are found between the large tendons of the forearm. Because tendon treats tendon, these points are good for cramping of the forearm or hand. Chest spasm: The above Dao Ma combination is very useful when treating the muscles of the chest cavity. This is true for any kind of contusion, such as from a car accident involving contact with an airbag or a steering wheel, or a situation of overuse or overexertion that results in muscular spasm of the chest or thorax. Gallbladder channel sciatica: Though there are many options for treating Gallbladder channel sciatica, 33.04 Fire Threaded, 33.05 Fire Mound and 33.06 Fire Mountain can be considered due to the connection between the Hand and Foot Shao Yang and the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD).

Weakness: For the treatment of anemia, dizziness, leg pain, blurred vision, low back pain and exhaustion, retain the needle for ten minutes, then moxa using 3-5 balls. Longevity: See Comments below. Tennis elbow, lower back pain and sciatica: Contact the bone with the needle shaft. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Muscle treats muscle: Needling in muscle tonifies earth and Spleen, restoring qi. In the name of this point, “huo” – meaning “fire” – indicates tonification of earth via the mother (fire). With the Reaction Area of the Heart and Lung, and needled toward the Pericardium, this point tonifies fire. Energetic pathways: Master Tung needled Fire Bowels Sea (LI10) and LI11 Qu Chi together but even closer to the bone, with the LI11 needle just distal to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, and the LI10 needle sliding down the edge of the radius. This approach creates a combined function for San Jiao and Large Intestine. The Yang Ming (LI) aspect, mirroring ST36, tonifies qi and blood (Yang Ming having more qi and more blood), and the San Jiao aspect strengthens the Kidney due to the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD). The latter, along with the bone-treating-bone Kidney function, contributes to the point’s effectiveness in the treatment of sciatica, back pain, weakness of the legs, anemia and exhaustion. Because of the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and Foot Jue Yin (LV), Fire Bowels Sea has the effect of dispersing wind (LV) and moving qi and blood (LI) to treat dizziness, blurred vision and fatigue. Because Large Intestine and Lung share an internal/external connection, this point also treats respiratory disorders. Longevity protocol: All of the above energetic relationships make Fire Bowels Sea useful in increasing longevity. To bring qi to the point, we start by needling Fire Bowels Sea superficially in four directions from the same point: needle toward one direction, pull the needle toward the surface but not completely out, then insert the needle toward the next direction, etc. Finally, leave the needle in a perpendicular position for the application of moxa. In Dr. Lee’s clinic, we often added a warm needling technique using moxa balls approximately the size of large marbles. We made these by firmly pressing moxa together with our fingers and qi, then splitting the ball, surrounding the handle of the needle with the two halves, and firmly pressing them together again, with qi. We bilaterally applied a moxa ball and burned it on the needle handle; we did this three times for a weak patient, and five times for a strong patient, every other day for three months. Every fifth, tenth and fifteenth treatment, we bilaterally burned 7-9 moxa balls. In modern clinics, moxa balls have been replaced by stick-on moxa, which cannot easily be applied to a needle. You can substitute two stick-on moxa per moxa ball and apply them directly to the point, using a small cardboard shield. Even better, heavily puncture a slice of ginger with a fork and place it over the point, then apply either moxa balls or stick-on moxa. Massage: For calf muscle injury or spasm or for loss of firm hand grip, massage this area from elbow to wrist (brachioradialis). Case history (muscle atrophy, Dr. Lee): “I once had a case of a man whose muscles in his entire body had atrophied. When he was a young man, he had made a foolish bet. He and a friend made a bet to see who could stay in the Pacific Ocean for the longest time. Before jumping in, this man drank a bottle of wheat germ oil. Wheat germ is a very nourishing substance and the oil of wheat germ is even more so. This wheat germ oil made his body warm and he was able to remain in the cold water the longest and won the bet. However, 20 years later, this man was reduced to a skeleton. He could not even feed himself or sit up for any length of time. Previously he had been very tall and athletic in build. Now he was just skin and bones. I needled 11.14 Finger Three Weights but was skeptical about its ability to treat such an advanced case. Therefore, I also applied moxa to LI10 Shou San Li, a point for longevity. This allowed him to at least regain the use of his arm so that he could feed himself. This man’s condition was due to cold injuring the Spleen” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

Due to the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yang (SI) and Foot Tai Yin (SP) channels, the Small Intestine is linked to the earth element, immune function, and dampness in the body. Acute colitis and acupressure: I teach my patients who have IBS and Crohn’s disease how to find Intestine Gate, as it can be life changing for people who are anxious about leaving their house and losing bowel control in public. Many of these patients will not board an airplane or even go shopping; they are obsessed and fearful to the point of having panic attacks. They are thrilled to discover that by holding this point firmly, they are able to control their bowels until they can locate a toilet. Dao Ma: Intestine Gate is frequently needled with 33.11 Liver Gate for treating issues such as hepatitis, because patients who have hepatitis often have intestinal issues as well; this is related to wood overly controlling earth.

Calf cramping: Liver Gate treats lower leg cramping because the Liver relates to tendons, and all Liver points are useful for treating tendons and spasms.

        "techniques": "Needle 0.3 - 0.5 cun towards the wrist. Needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Location: I have found Heart Gate to be more effective when it is needled 2.0 cun distal to the tip of the elbow, just beyond the flaring of the ulna. This location allows for deeper needling. Unilateral vs. bilateral: This point is needled unilaterally for conditions on the opposite side. It can be needled bilaterally to treat rheumatoid arthritis or coccyx pain. Needling technique: Start by inserting the needle perpendicularly until the bone is gently touched. Then, slightly withdraw the needle to a superficial level and reinsert, angling away from the bone. Repeat this process until you are able to identify the edge of the ulna. Insert the needle to a depth of 0.5-1.0 cun, sliding the shaft of the needle against the ulna for a bone-treating-bone, Kidney tonification effect. When tapping the bone, be sure to do it gently so as not to damage the periosteum. Using this approach, you can easily find the most powerful and effective location. Use strong stimulation on this point until the patient reports a change in their symptoms, especially when treating groin, elbow or coccyx pain. Rheumatoid arthritis may require further treatment before the patient notices improvement. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Heart Gate has the Reaction Area of the Heart and is located near SI8 Xiao Hai, the earth and He-Sea point of the Small Intestine meridian. The Heart and Small Intestine share an internal/external relationship. For all of these reasons, Heart Gate treats any disease related to the heart. In Tung’s system, any point with ”Heart” or “Fire” in its name treats both heart and knees. Additionally, imaging systems reveal a correspondence between the elbow and knee. Because of the connection between the Hand and Foot Tai Yang (SI/UB), Heart Gate also is used to treat symptoms related to sciatica and the low back, sacrum, and coccyx. Coronary heart disease: While Heart Gate is useful in the treatment of chronic heart disease, I rarely choose to use it without 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points or 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle, as these points are more powerful. Myocarditis: This problem is typically seen in younger people whose heart muscle was injured by a cold or flu. They may not realize that this has happened, but as a practitioner you may recognize this condition by its extreme shortness of breath and fatigue, uncommon in youth. The treatment of choice is to needle 33.12 Heart Gate or PC6 Nei Guan with 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36); further treatment information can be found in Combinations below. Groin pain: Heart Gate falls into the category of my favorite points due to its extraordinary effectiveness in the treatment of groin pain. We do not have many points to treat the vicinity of ST31; however, Heart Gate on the opposite side is all that is needed. Inflammation of the hip joint, or deterioration of the ball of the femur, is experienced in the groin. Groin pain may necessitate an X-ray to determine the extent of arthritic degeneration. Many patients and even practitioners use the phrase “hip pain” in reference to pain of the greater trochanter of the femur; however, they are referring to the Gallbladder channel. True hip joint pain, on the other hand, has a medial presentation in the groin. Groin pain with sciatica: If a patient is experiencing groin pain and sciatica, position them on their side, bending their top leg in order to thoroughly cup the affected side. Be sure to cup both GB29 and GB30 specifically. I also recommend cupping UB36 while the patient is lying on their side, as the skin color after cupping here is often extremely dark (indicating toxin buildup) whether or not the patient has UB channel sciatica. I often refer to UB36 as “sciatica looking for a place to happen.” When groin pain occurs simultaneously with sciatica, Heart Gate can be used in conjunction with SI3 Hou Xi, 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, and/or 22.06- 22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai. Guiding Points are optional. Knee pain: Common or acute knee pain usually improves quickly, especially for athletes who have been overusing their knees. Medial knee pain is caused by injury to the meniscus, degenerative joint disease, and/or bone spurring. Degenerative knee pain is present when the patient climbs and descends stairs; for this type of pain, I bilaterally needle 11.09 Heart Knee. If the knee pain is due to bone spurring, the pain is worse when the patient walks downhill or descends stairs; in this case, I use 33.12 Heart Gate on the opposite side, with 66.03 Fire Hardness or 66.04 Fire Master as Guiding Points to pull the qi directly into the knee. This combination is especially useful because the Liver controls tendons, and the knee joint is completely wrapped in tendons. 66.03 has a fire nature, whereas 66.04 has an earth nature; needling close to the bone will tonify the Kidney (water) on a wood channel, therefore treating wind, cold and damp by building fire and nourishing earth. It is my experience that bone spurs do not easily dissolve. However, soft tissue inflammation around the spur is usually responsible for most of the pain. Often bone spur pain is worse in heavier patients; treatments that release toxins can help to promote weight loss and resolve knee pain. 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle can be needled on the opposite side or bled on the same side (if a good vein is found). For pain underneath the kneecap (inside the joint), my favorite treatment is to bleed DT.07 Three Gold (same side or both sides). Often I suggest emulsified turmeric or boswellia compound as good anti-inflammatory agents to deal with knee pain from bone spurring. If both knees are equally painful, bilaterally needle 33.12 Heart Gate and LV2 or LV3 with strong stimulation. Case histories (inner knee pain, Dr. Lee): •  “Heart Gate can also treat inner leg pain and sacral area nerve pain. I use this point a lot with older patients. Most older patients have some heart problems. For some time I had failed to treat inner knee pain successfully. I searched and searched for an effective treatment protocol. One day a woman came to me suffering from dry heaves. I needled this point and not only did her dry heaves stop, but so did her inner knee pain. Since then I use this point to treat inner knee pain by needling the opposite side” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  “Another time, I went to Canada to treat an 88-year-old lady with sore legs and knees. She was quite obese and could not walk without a cane or a walker. I palpated her entire knee and found the most tender spot to be the inner knee. I needled Heart Gate, one time. The patient fell asleep and slept soundly for two hours. After that, all her leg pain and soreness disappeared, not only her inner knee pain. Since then I have never forgotten that inner knee pain is caused by the Heart” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Tailbone pain: I have frequently seen that two scenarios cause broken tailbones: elderly patients falling backwards onto cement, and women’s coccyx breaking during labor and delivery. Heart Gate is very effective when combined with 55.04-55.05 Flower Bone Three/Flower Bone Four to treat severe pain or fracture of the coccyx. For coccyx pain from a typical slip and fall, bilateral Heart Gate should be adequate. If the sacral pain has to do with prolapse (urinary bladder, uterine, hemorrhoid, etc.), needle DU19 and DU21 combined, through DU20, or directly moxa DU20. Over  time, I have discovered a few additional toxin areas (similar to DT.01-DT.02), one of which is located at the very base of the coccyx. Though this area is difficult to access, I am certain to apply a small cup to it when the patient is experiencing coccyx pain, especially from an old impact or fracture. (Never cup it within six months of a break.) Surprisingly, on most patients the skin in this area turns black when cupped. •  Rheumatoid arthritis: In treating rheumatoid arthritis, I have had extraordinary results using bilateral 33.12 Heart Gate, 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points, and 11.27 Five Tigers. I have also used direct moxa on joint nodules with good results; however, I caution practitioners to experiment on one joint first, to determine whether a particular patient responds positively to this kind of direct heat. Some patients may have inflammatory or heat-type rheumatoid arthritis that might be exacerbated by direct moxa. I have found cupping of DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas to be helpful, as well.",
        "combinations": "Elbow pain (medial, “golfer’s elbow”): Needle opposite-side 33.12 Heart Gate with same side SI3 Hou Xi as a Guiding Point (optional). •  Knee pain (bone spur): Needle opposite-side 33.12 Heart Gate, 77.09 Four Flower Middle, 77.11 Four Flower Lower. As a Guiding Point, needle 66.03 Fire Hardness and/or 66.04 Fire Master.

The patient is uncomfortable when the points are needled with the arms open alongside the body (palms up) for a prolonged period of time. For the comfort of the patient, needle this three-point unit with the patient lying on their back, arms alongside the body, palms down, with each wrist supported by a small, rolled-up hand towel.

Bleeding dark veins in the cubital fossa can treat the following conditions: asthma, digestive disorders, heart disease, shoulder and upper extremity pain, common cold and sore throat. | Johnson: This point is commonly bled for many indications, using any good vein that is small to medium sized on the anterior elbow crease. Avoid the artery. If you cannot locate a good vessel, needle the point, contacting the biceps tendon with the shaft of the needle. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun Positioning and needling: Support the wrist with a rolled-up hand towel so the patient can rest their arm with the palm downward, creating an arch where the needle will be. For easiest insertion, pull the elbow slightly outward, then rotate the wrist 90 degrees toward the ceiling. Have the patient keep their elbow in this position while you insert the needle between the two large tendons (palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis). Then rotate their wrist back to the palm-down position. Needle sensation: If the patient feels an electrical nerve sensation travelling to the hand, you do not need to further stimulate the needle. Gently turn the hand over to rest the arm with the needle in place. Note: It is common for patients to feel an electrical sensation during insertion and removal of the needle for certain points, such as PC6, SP6 and KD7. While the needle is retained, the sensation typically goes away, but if it does not, you can adjust or relocate the needle to stop the sensation. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Lung and Kidney: Because He-Sea points treat the reversal of qi, Curve Mound smooths the qi, helping to hold it up or raise it in cases of diarrhea, prolapse and incontinence, and helping to descend the qi for chest and lung conditions such as cough and asthma. This effect is due to the fact that it is a water point on a metal channel, and therefore has a powerful effect on both Lung and Kidney. If Lung energy is not descending, there is fast panting. If the Kidneys are not able to receive, breathing is long and labored. A forceful cough indicates an exterior wind attack, whereas the deep cough of chronic bronchitis indicates Kidney deficiency. When treating cough or asthma, bleed or sedate LU5. Lung and Liver: Curve Mound is an excellent point to sedate when metal is over- controlling wood, as with stroke and/or paralysis. Because it is located directly adjacent to the biceps tendon, and because tendon treats tendon, Curve Mound is frequently needled for cramping or spasms anywhere in the body, frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel or post-stroke syndromes. For any of these indications, we can needle the opposite side or bleed the same side. Alternatively, tonify Curve Mound to indirectly treat the Liver in deficiency cases when wood is excess, with indications such as irritability, depression, PMS, headaches, insomnia, etc. Another good option might be to moxa the areas of DT.07 Three Gold or UB13 Fei Shu to strengthen metal in order to control wood. Bleeding treatments: In 1987, Dr. Lee and I travelled to the Anhui Province in central China to study bleeding techniques with Dr. Xiu-Zhen Wang, a third generation doctor of bloodletting. Though Dr. Wang chose to bleed points that were specific to each case, her comprehensive bleeding treatment for clearing stagnation and increasing circulation included the bleeding of Tai Yang (Extra Point) to clear the head, LU5 to clear the upper body and UB40 Wei Zhong to clear the lower body. Because UB40 has more blood, it may also be used to clear the spine and the entire body. There is much more to say about this ancient healing art, as it is only with bleeding techniques that I have seen the truly miraculous occur. We must protect and advance this technique and work with our licensing boards to preserve it. Bleeding LU5: Curve Mound is the He-Sea and water point of the Lung meridian. It is a primary point to bleed in difficult cases and to clear stagnation in the upper body. In my clinic, I commonly bleed LU5 for: heart blockage, chest congestion (heart or lung), asthma, frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel, common cold with sore throat, red eyes, heat stroke, and problems of the head and/or face. LU5 is an excellent point to bleed for any kind of excess condition of the lungs, partly because as the water point, it puts out fire to resolve sore throat, tonsillitis, pneumonia and laryngitis. Horary: Dr. Young teaches that the most effective time to bleed LU5 is between 3:00–5:00 p.m. This is because of the Tai Yin/Tai Yang (LU/UB) relationship, and because this is the height of the Urinary Bladder time of day (horary). 155 Forearm Points Case history (red sclera): I once had an unexpected result in a LU5 bleeding demonstration. The student who volunteered to be treated had arrived that morning with completely bloodshot eyes. I did not ask the reason for this condition; however, we were all amazed to see the color of his sclera return to bright white in a matter of moments, while the blood was still gently flowing. Case history (feverish and irritable, Dr. Lee): Dr. Lee described bleeding LU5 for an angry woman who had a common cold and fever; not only did the fever break immediately, but the anger did too (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (cracked and bleeding palms and soles, Dr. Young): Dr. Young described a case in which he bled Curve Mound (LU5) and UB40 Wei Zhong for a patient with cracked and bleeding palms and soles; the patient’s skin began healing the next week. Why I include this point: Although it is not found in Master Tung’s acupuncture system, PC6 Inner Courtyard is included in this body of work because it is very powerful and I often combine it with Tung’s points. My location of this point, 3.0 cun (four fingers) above the wrist crease, is an ancient one, not a textbook TCM location. I have always found this location of Nei Guan to be incredibly effective. Part of the power of this point is due to its connection with the vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve), which has parasympathetic control of the heart, lungs and digestive tract. Because of this connection, Inner Courtyard opens the chest, regulates Heart qi, calms the spirit, harmonizes the stomach, relieves nausea and vomiting and regulates qi. All of the above illustrate the connection between the Pericardium and Stomach pathways. Energetic pathways: PC6 utilizes the special relationship between the Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST) as well as the Hand and Foot Jue Yin (PC/ LV) connection. When combined with SP4 Gong Sun, PC6 Nei Guan becomes the Coupling Point of the Chong Mai, which is utilizing the deeper Kidney points located on the chest and abdomen. Knee pain and heart disease: The Stomach and Liver channels are the main pathways through the knee. The Jue Yin connection to the Liver, in addition to the location of PC6 between two tendons (because tendon treats tendon) makes Nei Guan terrific for knee pain, especially when combined with LV3 as a Guiding Point on the same side. Many blood vessels, tendons and ligaments transit the knee, so Nei Guan also treats knee pain because blood vessels treat blood vessels. The Heart is responsible for blood vessels and circulation, while the Pericardium (heart protector) imprints emotions on the blood, making PC6 very useful in the treatment of chest congestion, palpitations, anxiety and heart disease. In Tung’s system, any point used to treat the heart is also effective for knee pain. Chest and abdominal congestion: Accessing the deeper Kidney points of the Chong Mai through stimulation of 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) with Inner Courtyard is my all-time favorite treatment for cock’s crow diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and abdominal or chest pain. On occasion, I add 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43) to the treatment, immediately relieving gas and bloating on the opposite side. For gastroenteritis, including IBS and Crohn’s disease, needle SP4 first and then PC6. If you are using the combination for palpitations, anxiety and chest pain, needle PC6 first. Case history (Crohn’s disease using 66.05, SP4, PC6): I have used the above combination in several instances to treat severe abdominal pain due to Crohn’s disease, but one case was especially memorable. The patient had post-surgical adhesions and scar tissue from the removal of a segment of intestines, had been taking steroids for six years, and was experiencing intense abdominal pain and diarrhea. After six months of treatment using the combination of ST43, SP4 and PC6, she tapered off steroids completely. Her dietary restrictions – avoiding inflammatory foods such as wheat, dairy, sugar, raw food, alcohol, spicy foods, caffeine, etc. – were initially severe and are now more relaxed. She was treated for approximately two years, and now, five years after her first visit, she still avoids inflammatory foods and drinks but enjoys them on special occasions with few, if any, intestinal repercussions. Old Doctors’ Two Old Needles: This is a classic combination of PC6 and ST36, used for coronary heart disease and heart failure, due to the special relationship between Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST) and the impact it has on the vagus nerve. For tight chest due to anxiety, PC6 with ST36 immediately relieves tension and opens the chest. In Tung’s system, we use 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle (Tung’s ST36) with very deep needle insertion (50-60mm) to relieve acute or chronic angina or severe excess frontal headache. Case history (Crohn’s disease using ST36): These points were also very effective for a case of Crohn’s disease in a patient who had postsurgical abdominal pain and diarrhea, and also presented with glaucoma. Because 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle are used for pressure behind the eyes as well as gastroenteritis, this combination of points effectively resolved both issues. 55.02 Flower Bone One, my favorite point combination for treating any eye disease, was also used regularly.",

Constitutional treatments may also be effective. Holographic images: In one system of correspondences, this area of the shoulder corresponds to the genitals, making it effective for treating diseases of the lower jiao, such as leucorrhea and vaginitis. In another system, the shoulder corresponds to the hips, so Cloud White may be combined with 44.06 Shoulder Center to treat weakness and distending pain of the hip, leg or calf muscles. This makes it additionally useful in the treatment of polio, muscle atrophy or hemiplegia, also due to the muscle-treating muscle function.

The two Dao Ma patterns cannot be combined, as one is on the anterior and one is on the posterior side of the arm. If the patient were positioned in a straight chair, this could be accomplished. Caution (high blood pressure): If the patient’s blood pressure is exceedingly high, I recommend bleeding DT.04 Five Mountain Range or the fingertips (more effective than bleeding the Jing Well points). A patient whose blood pressure is nearing 220/120 should not be allowed to leave the clinic until blood pressure treatments bring it down to around 150/90, after which time they should be directed to the nearest emergency room for medication.

A bone-treating-bone Kidney tonification function is activated when these points are needled close to the bone. Liver and Kidney Reaction Areas: Branch Through and Falling Through may be combined with 44.15 Lower Curve and 44.16 Upper Curve for hypertension, hemiplegia, dizziness, etc., because they share the Reaction Areas of Kidney and Liver, and also due to the KD/LV (mother/child) relationship. Considering the ease of location and efficacy, I am likely to choose 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors before I needle these points. The two Dao Ma patterns cannot be combined, as one is on the anterior and one is on the posterior side of the arm. If the patient were positioned in a straight chair, this could be accomplished. Caution (high blood pressure): If the patient’s blood pressure is exceedingly high, I recommend bleeding DT.04 Five Mountain Range or the fingertips (more effective than bleeding the Jing Well points). A patient whose blood pressure is nearing 220/120 should not be allowed to leave the clinic until blood pressure treatments bring it down to around 150/90, after which time they should be directed to the nearest emergency room for medication.

In Tung’s acupuncture system, we have two powerful examples of Kidney points found on the Spleen channel: Three Emperors, including 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan), and 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Fire Bag, located on the Stomach meridian, may be the most important point in all of Tung’s system because it can be used to save a life. Due to the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC), Fire Bag is a good emergency point to use when someone is having or has recently had a heart attack. “Huo” translates as “fire,” in this case meaning “heart.” “Bao” translates as “envelope” or “bag” (referring to the Pericardium). Because the Pericardium is the Heart Protector, points on the Pericardium channel are always chosen over points on the Heart channel. Emergency point for chest and Heart disorders: Dr. Lee used the metaphor of a balloon to represent the heart, and said that treating the heart directly by needling Heart channel points is like popping the balloon with a pin. Bleeding Fire Bag allows a slow release of pressure to stabilize the Heart and immediately resolve chest pain. When the heart is in spasm, circulation is compromised, and the hands and feet may be icy cold. Bleeding Fire Bag calms the spasm, reducing pressure in the chest. After the treatment, the patient will be able to breathe more easily and you will see proper color quickly return to their face. Heart attack or severe angina: In an emergency, when there is no time to acquire a bleeding needle, it may be necessary to use a sharp knife to bleed this point. This kind of situation is one in which a person may have a heart attack in the morning and die by evening. An acupuncturist who is prepared to bleed Fire Bag may be able to significantly reduce permanent damage to the heart before an ambulance arrives. Be sure to have someone call 911 immediately while you are bleeding Fire Bag. Angina: In cases of acute, mild or moderate angina, rather than bleeding Fire Bag, I deeply needle 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle to release pressure from the chest. I carry 60mm needles in the glove box of my car and have used them on multiple occasions for this reason. The Four Flower Line (Stomach meridian) utilizes the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC). When PC6 Nei Guan is added to 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36), the combination becomes an ancient point pattern called Old Doctors’ Two Old Needles. Gas pains mimic chest pain: It is far more common for chest pain to be caused by gas trapped in the chest than by a heart attack. People panic when they have chest pain; they may think they are dying and call you in the middle of the night. If they are able to easily talk to you on the phone, they are probably not having a heart attack. I suggest that in this situation, you ask the patient to firmly strike their sternum three times with a flat fist and then attempt to belch. In most cases this releases the gas and instantly relieves the chest pain. Anxiety chest pain: Anxiety is probably the most frequent cause of chest pain. Patients with chest pain from anxiety are likely to think they may be dying. You may or may not be able to calm them down; such patients typically need a trip to the emergency room and an EKG to be convinced that they are not having a heart attack. Labor and delivery concerns: Retained placenta: Delivering a retained placenta is the primary use of textbook Du Yin (Extra Point), also known as 55.01 Fire Bag. We may also use PC6 Nei Guan and GB21 Jian Jing for this purpose; however, a quick prick of Fire Bag with a lancet usually does the job. Never pull on the umbilical cord to encourage the release of the placenta, as this would cause a piece of the placenta to remain in the uterus, resulting in bleeding that will not stop. Should this happen, the patient will need to be transported to the emergency room for a D&C. Always check a delivered placenta to insure that it is completely intact. Difficult delivery: There are so many effective ways to induce labor or speed delivery that I would only choose to bleed Fire Bag on a laboring mother if nothing else seemed to work. Nonstop bleeding: Fire Bag is said to be useful to treat nonstop bleeding after delivery or traumatic injury when blood loss is not dramatic, but I have not tried it for this purpose. Hernia: In a case of twisted intestine or acute intestinal hernia when swelling prevents the hernia from receding, it may help to bleed Fire Bag. Both of these conditions are excruciatingly painful and the patient may require surgical attention. When surgically “violated,” the intestines are likely to develop adhesions and scar tissue. If you are able to treat the patient first, surgical scar tissue may be avoided. Liver cancer: Fire Bag is said to prolong the life of liver cancer patients, although I have never used it in this way. The Stomach meridian treats liver diseases due to the special relationship between the Stomach and Pericardium meridians and the internal/ external relationship between the Hand and Foot Jue Yin (PC/LV). Epilepsy: Some TCM textbooks say that Fire Bag, also known as Du Yin, is bled for patients experiencing a grand mal seizure. Though this approach seems theoretically sound, it is hard to imagine accessing this area when a patient is having an excess- type seizure. For treatment of a deficient or flaccid-type seizure, I would not bleed this point. Flower Bone Points Flower Bone Points—“Hua” translates as “flower;” “Gu” translates as “bone.” We can generally state the following (Dr. Young, 2008): Flower Bone One treats the eyes and head (upper jiao). Flower Bone Two treats the arms (middle jiao). Flower Bone Three treats the waist (lower jiao). Flower Bone Four treats the sit bones (lower jiao).",

        "techniques": "Needle 0.5 - 1 cun . | Johnson: Needle bilaterally. Introduction to Flower Bone points: For success in using Flower Bone point patterns, palpation is essential. Once the practitioner has developed extremely sensitive fingers and has accurately located these points on four or five pairs of feet, needling will be more or less routine. In my supervision classes, we spend up to an hour per student perfecting palpation of these points. In my opinion, this time is very well spent, as the Flower Bone One points are unsurpassed when it comes to treating difficult eye diseases. The following description of precise palpation and needling of Flower Bone One also applies to the other Flower Bone Points (Flower Bone Two, Three and Four), Point Location and Needling Technique. Although the description below is lengthy, the clues provided make all the difference in successfully locating and needling the Flower Bone points: Patient positioning: For almost thirty years, I have needled these points on patients lying face down. When a patient is in this position, I place a pillow under their lower legs, suspending their toes slightly above the table so their feet are completely relaxed. I do not have them place their head in a face cradle for the short time that they will be lying face down, because it is important that their feet are close to the end of the table during palpation and needling. After needling, because this needle pattern requires lengthy retention (up to one hour or more), I help the patient turn over onto their back. This is most easily done if they swing their legs over the side of the table and sit up, then rotate their hips and lie down on their back. I place a bolster beneath their knees. Most patients are more comfortable lying on their back for the duration of the treatment, and additional points may be needled more easily in this position, as well. It was only recently, with a patient who was unable to lie on their stomach, that I taught myself how to needle these points with the overhang produced when the patient is lying face up. I highly recommend that first, you master palpating and needling these points with the patient face down, when the plantar surface of the feet is more easily accessible and you have the advantage of gravity. Palpation: Palpating the points is by far the most difficult aspect of properly applying the Flower Bone point patterns. It is absolutely necessary that you sit at the foot of the table, nearly eye level with the patient’s feet; it is impossible to accurately palpate the location of the points while standing, as your wrists will not be able to manage the angle required. Marking the feet: In supervision classes, my students mark the balls of each other’s feet, and then a supervisor checks the marks before students begin needling. The student practitioner sits at the foot of the table, facing the plantar surface of their partner’s feet, and carefully palpates the proximal side of the metatarsal-phalangeal joints, marking what they feel on the feet. When students are using their eyes and not their palpation skills, they tend to inaccurately draw the metatarsal heads in a straight line across the ball of the foot. Accurate palpation reveals that the proximal edge of the distal heads of the first and fifth metatarsal bones are significantly larger and superior to the three metatarsal heads in between. (See drawing above.) Tip versus top: When identifying the proximal edge of the distal metatarsal heads, it is important to find the high point of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint and roll a finger over the proximal edge. Most students palpate the tip of the bone (see the dot on the metatarsal-phalangeal head in the drawing of the right foot, shown above) and call it the top. However, the top is the most proximal edge, and it is located more deeply than the tip. The tip of the bone is what makes contact with the ground when we walk. Misinterpretation of tip for top (rolling over the proximal edge of the metatarsal) is one of the most frequent mistakes made by students learning these points, and it inevitably results in their needle hitting bone. Push on the toes: If you have a hard time locating the metatarsal heads, push down on the corresponding toe and the metatarsal head will pop right up. Find all five metatarsals: It is essential to locate the correct number of metatarsals. When people are standing, the bones of their feet spread; however, when the feet are not weighted, the bones may somewhat overlap, giving the appearance that one metatarsal is missing. Focusing on just one at a time, you will be able to differentiate all five. If the lateral edges of the metatarsal heads overlap, draw them that way. It is at the intersections of these bones, overlapping or not, that the needles are inserted. Needling: Due to the wide variation of bone structure in feet, this is one of the most difficult point patterns to needle correctly. Because the foot bones are very close 191 Plantar Foot Points together, there is absolutely no room for error. As people age, their feet become increasingly misshapen, so it is essential that you practice foot palpation until your perception of the bones beneath your fingers is perfected. Needle gauge: It is a good idea to teach yourself to wield a thin needle. I usually use 0.15 x 30 mm needles (#1, 40-gauge needle) for all of the Flower Bone points. Thinner gauge needles will bend without your knowing it, while larger gauge needles are unnecessarily painful. Remember that every time you touch a bone with a needle, the patient feels it. Nerves and blood vessels: These needles are not painful unless they plow into the bone or hit a blood vessel. The feet are extraordinarily expressive, and a mild curling of the toes may simply indicate sensation on the plantar surface, where nerve endings are very close together. It is fine to proceed if you see this kind of reaction. However, if you hit a blood vessel, the toes may radically curl or the foot may twitch significantly. Should this happen, you must decide whether to needle quickly through the vessel or remove and/or redirect the needle. It is not always necessary to remove the needle when the sensation occurs after initial insertion, causing the foot to jump. I highly recommend using needle guide tubes with a strong tap in order to move quickly and efficiently through this highly innervated area. Perceiving needle depth: Always use both hands and keep the fingers of your non-needling hand on the dorsum of the foot (in the patient’s Liver valley), as this enables you to feel the subtle pressure of the approaching needle tip. The inside of the epidermis on the dorsum is just as sensitive as the surface of the skin, so placing one hand on the dorsum of the foot gives you information necessary to know when to stop, thereby reducing needle sensitivity for the patient. This technique also provides counter-pressure and assures that the practitioner is aware of the precise location of the needle. Retention: One-hour retention is required. Removing the needles: This is considered deep needling, so when removing a needle, place a finger on each side of it and pull up firmly. If the patient’s foot twitches as you needle a point, it is likely that you have hit a small blood vessel, so when pulling the needle, be prepared for a tiny drop of blood. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Extraordinary points for the eyes: Dr. Lee taught me to use Flower Bone One, and it has become one of my specialties. In one of Dr. Young’s classes I asked him why he was not recommending Flower Bone One, and he said he doesn’t use these points due to their inconvenience. He was correct in stating their degree of difficulty. However, I use these points all the time and find them to be absolutely miraculous in the treatment of extraordinarily difficult eye diseases, such as optic nerve atrophy, glaucoma, and macular degeneration, all of which I have successfully treated multiple times. Without these points, I would have no confidence in positive outcomes for these disorders. In addition to these rather severe conditions, Flower Bone One can also be used for: nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, night blindness, eye inflammation, tearing eyes, photophobia, itching or irritated eyes, trachoma and eyelid infection. Liver and Kidney energetic pathways: The eyes are the opening to the Liver; the Kidney is the mother of the Liver. Flower Bone One, found in the Liver valley, treats the anatomy of the eye, but in order to treat the vision we must add points that relate to the Kidneys, such as: 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors, substituting 77.28 Bright Light (Tung’s KD7) for 77.21 Man Emperor (Tung’s SP6), along with GB20 Feng Chi and GB37 Guang Ming. Case histories (optic nerve atrophy): A 35-year-old woman presented with vertigo and dizziness. Her condition had been diagnosed as Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, an inner ear problem that produces a pronounced and persistent rocking sensation after leaving a boat. She could not walk without falling down. I treated her vertigo and dizziness with 88.17-88.19 Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three, but her condition did not improve. I also cupped her neck and jaw in order to restore proper blood flow to her brain. This resolved her migraine headaches and TMJ, but the rocking did not change. Both of us were discouraged, and she discontinued treatment. A few weeks later, she was diagnosed with optic nerve atrophy. When she was 15 years old, she had a brain tumor removed; now, twenty years later, scar tissue was impacting her optic nerve. I had been on the wrong track in treating her inner ear. I asked her to return for Flower Bone One, and after two treatments the vertigo completely stopped. I recommended at least ten visits and suggested one treatment per quarter, indefinitely, to continually strengthen the optic nerve in response to the continuous accumulation of scar tissue. A student asked if I would recommend needling these points for a one-year-old baby with optic nerve issues. Unless you have needled these points quite often, I recommend training the child’s parents to use acupressure to massage these points for five minutes, three times daily. Alternatively, you could also teach them to apply Koryo Hand Therapy pellets17 to Flower Bone One. Case histories (glaucoma): Often in my practice, random patients show up concurrently with the same disease process, even a rare one. This happened more than twenty years ago when I found myself treating three different patients with glaucoma simultaneously: The first patient was a 65-year-old man with glaucoma and Crohn’s disease. He had multiple laser surgeries on both eyes, and a large portion of his intestine had been removed. Once each week, I treated him with Flower Bone One and then had him turn onto his back and needled 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle, points used for pressure behind the eyes as well as gastroenteritis. His intraocular pressure started to descend nicely, from 22 mmHg to 12 mmHg. His visual field exams also radically improved, and he was able to entirely discontinue his glaucoma medication. With additional support from an herbal formula, his Crohn’s disease was completely healed within three months. The second glaucoma patient was born with congenitally closed tear ducts. Within 24 hours of his birth, the optic nerves were destroyed, leaving him legally blind and with glaucoma. Because the first patient’s treatment had worked so well, I used the same treatment with the second patient. This patient’s intraocular pressure reduced from 19 mmHg to 11 mmHg and stayed there. I treated him once weekly for the first year and occasionally over the following three years. Now, 17 Tae-Woo Yoo, Koryo Hand Therapy (2001) 193 Plantar Foot Points nineteen years later, and without further treatment for his eyes, he is still free of glaucoma medication, though his visual field exams will never improve. The third patient was 73 years old when he entered my practice. He loved nothing more than to spend all of his days tending his orchards on his tractor, in the sun and wind. Because of this, his eyes were like those of a 90-year-old. I tried to use the treatment that had worked so well with the other two patients, but when I saw no obvious improvement within a few weeks, I had to check my thinking. Once I began to use Flower Bone One with modified Two Emperors (77.18 Shen Guan and 77.28 Bright Light), the patient’s eyes began to improve. This patient was never able to discontinue using eye drops, but his visual field exams got better and better. He is now 93 years old and can still be found in the orchards, surrounded by walnuts and oranges. Cautions: Treatment may reduce the intraocular pressure and improve the visual field. Once the pressure is lowered, the patient may need additional treatments at least quarterly, to prevent the pressure from rising again. Monitor carefully. The first patient described above, with glaucoma and Crohn’s disease, never had bowel problems again; however, his intraocular pressure increased after ten years without treatment. This was a learning experience for me. Macular degeneration: This condition can be difficult to treat. Initially, these patients need to be treated at least weekly, though it is better to treat them three times a week for the first few weeks. Chronic conditions such as macular degeneration require a minimum of ten treatments before the practitioner can assess whether the condition will improve. If there are no signs of change and the patient is younger than 80 years old, continue with another ten treatments before making your determination. Patients older than 80 are less likely to respond, due to lack of circulation and significantly diminished eyesight. Case histories (macular degeneration): I simultaneously treated a father and daughter who were both suffering from macular degeneration. The father was 78 years old and had the dry type of macular degeneration. With the application of 55.02 Flower Bone One, 77.18-77.19 Three Emperors, GB20 Feng Chi and GB37 Guang Ming, the progression of the disease stopped completely. Recently, the patient reported that his vision had improved and he noticed wavy lines only when he was very tired. We continue treatment bi-monthly so that he will continue to be able to read and drive. Older eyes usually respond more slowly to treatment, and their condition may not reverse or improve. This man’s daughter was in her early 50s and suffered from the wet type of macular degeneration. She had received injections into her eyeballs every ten days to treat this condition. It was expected that over time, the injections would be less and less frequent. Unfortunately, her response to the injections was not good, and after six months, she still required them regularly. After four acupuncture treatments in four weeks, she was able to wait two weeks between injections. After four months of weekly acupuncture, she was able to receive her injections six weeks apart. At that point, I referred her to another practitioner and have not heard about her progress since. I treated an 80-year-old patient who also had the wet type of macular degeneration. She came to me after receiving injections in her eyeballs for a number of months. She vowed never to have these injections again because she had an allergic reaction to the medication that had caused her severe pain in both eyes after the last two injections. She lived alone and was extremely distraught about the possibility of losing her driver’s license and therefore her freedom. With this motivation, she came for treatment three times weekly. I also treated her for upper back, neck and arm pain. The cupping of her neck and shoulders, where the skin was black after cupping, helped to open the blockage to her eyes. After eight weeks of treatment and no further injections, she saw a new ophthalmologist who reviewed the records sent by her previous doctor, claimed that her eyes had improved, and said she no longer required the injections. Due to her age, she will always require at least quarterly treatment to maintain this improved condition. A number of years ago, I treated a 90-year-old who had no central vision at all, and the treatments were unsuccessful in making any noticeable change. We discontinued treatment after twelve visits in three months, as her degeneration was too far advanced. Additional information about these three case histories: Although I thoroughly cupped the neck and shoulders of the three successfully treated patients mentioned above, I did not bleed their Tai Yang area or Ear Apex. If I had had less encouraging results with any of them, I would have bled these areas. All three patients took Chinese patent herbal medicines for their eyes and also the supplement called Complete Eye Factor, a combination of zinc and lutein. Cataracts: Since the advent of corrective lenses used in cataract surgeries and the fact that the vision is immediately restored after these surgeries, I always recommend that patients take advantage of this surgical correction offered via allopathic medicine. Eye diseases (commentary, Dr. Lee): “Flower Bone One is very good for eye diseases. There is not much trachoma in the United States but there are many cases of red eyes or conjunctivitis due to overeating fried foods and drinking alcohol. Inflammation of the eyelids may also be due to overdrinking alcohol, especially if the alcohol is poor quality. Eyes sensitive to the wind and fearing light are symptoms of Liver Yin deficiency. Patients with this type of condition should go to bed early, usually before 9:00 pm. Such people have used up their Liver Blood. Going to bed early allows the Liver to refill with Blood. Going to bed late prevents the Liver from storing the Blood adequately. Therefore, besides doing acupuncture, such patients also must change their lifestyle” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Herbal formulas: For weakness of the eyes or degenerative eye diseases, I frequently combine a few herbal formulas: Lycii & Chrysanthemum (Qi Ju Di Huang Wan), Bright Eye Rehmannia (Ming Mu Di Huang Wan), Dendrobium Night Sight Pills (Shi Hu Ye Guang Wan) and a supplement called Complete Eye Factor by Vital Health, a combination that includes zinc and lutein. Zinc is reported to halt the progression of macular degeneration.",

However, people with bulging discs are not able to turn over easily, so I suggest that you teach yourself to needle these points with the patient lying comfortably on their back. •  Leg and foot numbness (Dr. Lee): “Flower Bone Three and Flower Bone Four treat the entire leg as well as numbness of the legs and feet. During treatment, typically the numbness gives way to tingling and then the tingling goes away. If the patient complains about these sensations, explain that they are normal in the process of recovery. While the patient is lying down with the needles in place, have the patient raise their legs one at a time so the stimulation moves down from their hips to their lower legs. The effect is not as good if one does not move the legs in this way. Otherwise, this is a very effective point combination with good results from only a few needles” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Abdominal pain: 55.05 Flower Bone Four treats stomach and lower abdominal pain; however, nothing works better for these conditions than 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43). •  Stops bleeding: 55.05 Flower Bone Four stops bleeding; however, 66.08 Sixth Finish might be a better choice.",

This area can be sensitive, so insert the needle quickly. Upper Tumor can be used for those who have had an operation for a brain tumor and are still in pain or recuperating. The patient should feel their head clear after the needle is inserted. If the patient feels that their head becomes more distended after this point is needled, remove the needle(s). Calluses: Patients who frequently walk barefoot may have a hard callus on the distal edge of their heel. Place your needle in front of or behind the callus and target the point from an angle. Adding Upper Tumor: Needling this area does not interfere with other treatments on the regular meridians, but it carries those treatments’ effects to the head. Depth: 0.5 cun maximum",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: The sole of the foot relates to the Kidney, and the Kidney governs the brain. In imaging systems, we use the bottom to treat the top, and because Upper Tumor has the Reaction Area of the cerebellum, it is particularly effective in any kind of brain excess, including edema, inflammation, infection or nerve damage. Brain tumor: Any kind of growth in the brain, including scar tissue, should be considered urgent, because the neurological impact of even tiny amounts of accumulating abnormal tissue can result in the loss of sensory or motor function, memory, or cognitive abilities. When a patient has an aggressive brain tumor, whether it is malignant or benign, I treat them as often as possible, alternating between the two variations of Upper Tumor combined with either 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 77.27 Outer Three Gates, depending upon whether the tumor is cancer related or not. If there is malignancy somewhere in the body, I needle 77.27 Outer Three Gates and add a point or point pattern to carry its influence to the affected area. In this case, Upper Tumor directs the treatment toward the brain. Diagnostics: Several indications are common to brain tumors, including: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, severe headache, and the inability to walk in a straight line and/or to speak coherently. The presentation depends on the type of tumor and its location. Caring for the terminally ill: The prognosis may be dismal in such cases. However, when a practitioner is able to provide any amount of symptomatic relief (while being careful not to give a guarantee of false hope), it is enormously helpful to the patient and their families or caregivers. These situations also give us the opportunity to provide a strong shoulder for those who are faithfully taking care of their beloved around the clock. After thirty years of practice, I have come to see the similarities between birth and death and to know without a doubt that showing up and helping in whatever way I can is deeply impactful. When people are afraid, it is truly important for them to feel seen and heard. Open your heart to such painful situations and know that you will grow from them in inconceivable ways. Case history (brain tumor, Dr. Lee): “A little girl was brought to me with a brain tumor. An MRI showed that the tumor was very big. When she first came, her condition was already quite bad. She only seemed semiconscious. She could not answer questions or even open her mouth to show her tongue. I needled this point 203 Plantar Foot Points and after 45 minutes she became more responsive. She could answer questions, show her tongue, and even began playing with the curtain around the treatment table. Her eyeballs no longer turned up and were clear. However, the next day, she was even more unconscious. She seemed to be able to listen and to answer ‘yes,’ but I do not believe she actually understood what she was saying. When asked if she wanted to go to the hospital, she said ‘yes.’ She went to the hospital and never came out” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (glioblastoma): I treated a 42-year-old female patient with an aggressive brain tumor that had been diagnosed recently. She presented with irrational and irate behavior, extreme headache, nausea and vomiting. I knew I had very little time to respond, so I treated her every day that I could. After the first treatment, in which I used 11.17 Wood (Anger), Three Stove Bottom and 77.05-77.07 Three Weights, she stopped vomiting and was able to eat small amounts regularly; her headache became moderate and intermittent. Subsequently, I alternated variations of Upper Tumor with Three Weights or 77.27 Outer Three Gates. She still had occasional bursts of anger, and these were very difficult for her family members, who knew they were losing her. Two weeks later, on the day she died, all of the symptoms returned for a few hours, and then she was gone. Her identical twin sister is still a patient in my practice today. Case history (glioblastoma): This kind of cancer is extremely aggressive, and often the best we can do is offer palliative treatment. This patient, a 38-year-old female, had been put on an extreme ketogenic (high fat/low carb) diet by her oncologist to try to control the growth of the cancer. She was eating pounds of bacon and blueberries. Though she passed away four months later, I treated her in her home three times a week and taught the treatment to her family members. She was able to put her affairs in order and say her goodbyes, but this was a case we could not win. Case history (5.5mm benign brain tumor): In 2008, a 70-year-old man who lived two hours from my office presented with severe facial pain following the surgical removal of a tumor on the right side of his brain. Prior to his surgery, he was dizzy and falling down, and had an earache and difficulty swallowing. He was informed that the surgery would certainly cause loss of hearing on the right side and would likely result in extreme facial pain. After the surgery, he could not handle the excruciating facial pain and he spoke of suicide. Surgical intervention that causes damage to nerves is a common cause of untreatable pain. I began treatment using Three Weights and Upper Tumor on the side opposite the tumor. The treatment did not resolve the facial pain but did improve it; the patient reduced his pain medications and safely drove the long distance to my office by himself. Not long after we began treatment, he was diagnosed with another tumor of the same kind on the left side of his brain. His surgeon wanted to quickly use cyberknife technique before the tumor grew too large to be treated without opening the cranium. Because the patient had been told that another surgery would cause him to lose his hearing completely, and due to his long commute, I referred him to one of my students closer to his home. I would have liked to have worked with him longer; we may have been able to regenerate the damaged nerves involved in his facial pain and surgical deafness. Blood stagnation headaches: Upper Tumor is particularly useful in treating headache or brain tumor with nausea and vomiting, especially when these occur at night. Stagnation-type headaches may increase when the patient lies still, and they are often worse between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Bleeding: For severe headache and brain tumor, also consider bleeding Tai Yang, UB40 Wei Zhong, 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 77.14 Four Flower Outer (Tung’s ST40). When preparing to bleed, always look for a vein in the general area rather than looking for the point. In imaging systems, we use the bottom to treat the top, so both legs may be utilized; however, if the tumor is on one side only, be sure to bleed the same side. Occipital pain: Upper Tumor combines beautifully with 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons to treat the area of the cerebellum. Case history (severe headaches, Dr. Lee): “A 50-year-old woodcutter was knocked down by a tree and his head was shaken backwards violently. After being hospitalized, he still had severe headaches all the time. Each time his physician refilled his pain medication it would be for 100 pills, and his wife had to inject him with morphine every three hours. Over a period of two years, he had five heart attacks due to such heavy pain medication, since it is well known that pain medications affect the heart. Finally, a doctor referred him to me with severe insomnia and severe headache. I needled 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons. He then slept, hard. After 45 minutes he awoke and I asked him to gently shake his head. He shook it a little and there was no pain. Then I asked him to shake it more forcefully and still there was no pain. The man stood up. He said he could not believe it. I asked him what he could not believe. He just kept saying he could not believe it. I called his wife into the office and she asked him what he could not believe. He said he could not believe he no longer had a headache. Then she said she could not believe it. I explained to the patient that he should not do any heavy lifting or any heavy work. He left my office and returned home. After sitting around the house for one week, the man grew bored and did some digging in order to plant some flowers. This caused him to get a headache again. He came back to my office and we did several more treatments. Finally we got rid of all his headaches” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

Have the patient move their thumb as you are stimulating the needle for approximately 10 seconds; this not only serves as a good distraction but also guides the qi (Active Qi Moving) to the thumb from the farthest distance possible. Unilaterally needle the opposite side for thumb and index finger pain. Seal may be needled bilaterally for internal disorders, but due to its sensitivity I never use this point for any issues other than thumb pain, for which it is unsurpassed. Needle type: 0.16 x 15mm needle (Japanese gauge 1, Chinese gauge 40). Depth: 0.3-0.4 cun or until you tap the distal phalanx.",
        "comments": "Thumb pain: Seal is extraordinary in the treatment of acute or chronic thumb pain. Elderly patients who fall on their hands, massage practitioners, arthritic patients and even acupuncturists love the effects of Seal in spite of its sensitivity. Most patients who arrive in my office do not have a primary complaint of thumb pain; however, in a thorough history taken on the first visit, I may discover that the thumb joint needs attention. Because Seal represents the most distal trajectory (big toe to opposite thumb), it needs to be needled by itself in order to maintain a clear energetic line, so Seal should be inserted as soon as possible if other treatments are planned for the same day. I often place a note on the outside of the patient’s file folder reminding me to needle Seal immediately, especially if the patient needs to wait for my full attention because the clinic is busy. By the time I rejoin them in the treatment room, Seal has already been working to address their thumb pain, and by the time we discuss their progress since the last treatment, we can usually move on to treating an issue other than thumb pain. Most patients need multiple issues addressed in every treatment. If the patient only wants treatment for their thumb pain, I needle opposite-side 11.27 Five Tigers One and Two with opposite-side Seal, while the patient rotates the affected thumb until the pain is gone (approximately two minutes); then I add Five Tigers One on the same side as a Guiding Point. Since discovering Seal’s effectiveness, I love to treat patients who have thumb pain. Thenar eminence pain: Seal is most effective for the two most distal joints and does not seem to affect the metacarpal bone itself. To treat the thenar eminence, consider using these points on the side opposite the indications: 22.01-22.02 Double Child/ Double Fairy, 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai, SJ5 Wai Guan and 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), or 22.11 Earth Water. These points are all effective for hand pain. Vaginitis: Seal treats gynecological problems because it strengthens the Spleen and clears dampness. However, instead of using these points, I always use 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points, 11.17 Wood (Anger) and 66.02 Wood Wife, because they are less painful to needle and much more powerful.",

In the point name, the word ‘wood’ indicates a relationship to Liver. Wood Wife treats wood attacking earth (Liver and Spleen disharmony) as well as damp heat in the Liver and Gallbladder. Gynecological indications: Wood Wife is usually combined with 11.17 Wood (Anger), 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. Because Wood Wife is sensitive, I only use it when the situation includes vaginal discharge or irritation. Patients with interstitial cystitis or vulvadynia will remember this point and adamantly request it, especially premenstrually, because it provides immediate relief. Interstitial cystitis (IC): This problem is becoming far more prevalent in modern society as women find themselves overcommitted, overwhelmed, angry and resentful. I frequently use Wood Wife to treat burning urine and interstitial cystitis due to anger; however, there are also many other components in the treatment of interstitial cystitis: KHT bleeding: The most effective treatment I have found for interstitial cystitis is slightly painful, but patients find it well worth the temporary discomfort. This Koryo Hand Therapy (KHT) treatment is the bilateral bleeding of the lower A-line (midline) on the palm. In KHT, the central line from the middle finger to PC7 Da Ling is considered the Conception Vessel. Using a spring-loaded lancet, begin puncturing about 1.3 cm distal to PC7 Da Ling, and make approximately five punctures close together (within 1 cm) on the midline. Then, lateral to the midline on each side, make an additional line of four punctures that are spaced in between the points of the midline. Puncture all of the points on both hands quickly, then squeeze each hand and swipe off the beads of blood. This way, the patient does not anticipate the puncturing of the second hand while you swipe the first hand. Needle treatment: Needle left side 11.17 Wood (Anger), unilaterally needle 66.02 Wood Wife; bilaterally needle 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water, 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors, LV3/LI4 Four Gates; deep needle REN3 Zhong Ji or REN4 Guan Yuan (50mm needle). I may add the Prefrontal Scalp Points if the patient has trouble sleeping, is depressed or has a lot of anxiety. This represents more acupuncture needles than are usually used in a single treatment, but IC is a complicated condition and I have found it responds well to the treatment described here. Dietary triggers: Diet is an important component in the treatment of interstitial cystitis. Chemicals of any kind must be strictly avoided, as must any inflammatory foods and beverages, such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy food, and processed sugar. If the patient is aware of triggers produced by grains or dairy, those too must be removed from the diet. I have had many good results in the treatment of IC, but not without strict dietary compliance. Blocked fallopian tube: Sticky phlegm is a common cause of infertility due to blocked fallopian tubes. If a tube is blocked, the qi is blocked. Choose this point to free the blockage, harmonizing Liver and Spleen. Controlling Liver fire: “For premenstrual or menopausal women, the practitioner should primarily treat the Liver. Women with hormonal imbalances may have a tendency toward anger, worry and frustration. These emotions can generate Liver fire, inflaming the Heart. 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors with Wood Wife is a good combination to soften the Liver and nourish water in order to control fire” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Fire Hardness is the fire point on a wood meridian; it tonifies fire and strengthens the Heart. As the Ying-Spring point, it clears heat to address conditions such as urethra infection and uterine inflammation. Fire Hardness is used as an emergency point for the heart due to its proximity to the Tai Chong artery (first dorsal metatarsal artery), the Jue Yin connection (LV/PC), and the fact that blood vessel treats blood vessel. It opens the jaw to treat conditions such as TMJ because wood governs the tendons. Fire Hardness treats dizziness because Liver controls wind. For all of the above reasons, it is especially effective when used to treat fainting or coma. 19 Textbook LV2: In the list of indications, please note those designated with an asterisk (*). These indications are included because they are associated with Textbook LV2 and are also relevant to 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2). Treating a slow heart rate (Dr. Lee): “One usually drains the Liver, but when the pulse is too slow one must supplement the Liver instead. Liver is the mother of the Heart, supplementing the Liver nourishes its child, the Heart. Fire Hardness is quite useful. Fire in its name indicates the Heart. Heart palpitations can either be fast or slow. Fire Hardness treats slow palpitations. A slow pulse indicates the heart does not have enough strength to pump. Therefore, supplement this point to nourish the Heart. One can also supplement this point to treat unconsciousness with a slow pulse. Elderly people who move slow, have slow responses, look old beyond their years, and have a pulse that beats less than three times per respiratory cycle may die within two years if left untreated. Even if a person’s pulse is slow because of athletic training, this is not so good. Although people say this is good, it is well known that athletes do not tend to be long-lived. This is because when the heart beats too slowly it is easy for other problems to develop. Such a slow heartbeat signifies that the heart is weak” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Urogenital indications: Fire Hardness treats urinary pain as well as gynecological problems including fibroids and tumors, because the Liver channel travels through the groin and reproductive area. Urinary bladder infections: In my clinic, I have found that most women with bladder infections have been extremely angry in the 24 hours preceding onset. The rising Liver fire hits the Heart, transferring the heat to the Small Intestine and thereby the Urinary Bladder. Because I so frequently see this connection, my first question to a woman with a bladder infection is, “Did you recently get really angry?” Ten times out of ten, the answer is, “Yes!” 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2) is an important point to treat this condition because it is the Ying-Spring and fire point on the Liver meridian which flows through the genitals, and thus it clears heat. Void after sex: I always advise patients to urinate after sex in order to flush bacteria from their urethra. This simple practice can stop many infections from taking hold. Opposite-side foot pain: If a patient has pain on the dorsum of the foot, Fire Hardness and/or 66.04 Fire Master can be needled on the opposite foot to treat the pain. I have found it helpful to oil and rub (Gua Sha) the painful area using a porcelain soup spoon or using my finger if the area is bony. If both sides are equally painful, treat them consecutively, not simultaneously. Anxiety and insomnia: Long ago, Dr. Young taught me to use a “fire” type of Four Gates, with 22.04 Da Bai and 66.03 Fire Hardness (also known as Anxiety Four Gates). To these points I may add the Prefrontal Scalp Points for anxiety and insomnia.",
        "combinations": "Most of the following combinations utilize the Dao Ma of 66.03 Fire Hardness and 66.04 Fire Master. Because Fire Hardness is a powerful point either alone or in combination, this section includes all of the combinations that utilize both 66.03 and 66.04.

        "comments": "Overview: Tung’s LV3, 66.04 Fire Master is located in the depression just proximal to textbook LV3 Tai Chong. As an earth point on a wood channel needled close to the bone (Kidney), Fire Master tonifies Liver (wood), Spleen (earth) and Kidney (water), thus treating wind, damp and cold, and making it a very good point for tendons, muscles and joints. These influences also make this point useful for digestive 219 Foot and Ankle Points disorders, including nausea, vomiting or nervous stomach. It is an excellent choice in any situation when wood and earth are not harmonious. Because of Fire Master’s distal location over a primary artery and its relationship to the blood vessels and tendons, it is the best Guiding Point for knee and groin issues. It is often needled as the Chief Point with 66.03 Fire Hardness for emergencies. Fire Master strengthens the heart via the Liver/Pericardium/Heart connection. It shares the textbook TCM functions of LV3; thus, it also clears Liver fire and subdues yang; disperses wind; calms Liver qi and moves stagnation; nourishes Liver yin and blood; clears the head and eyes; drains damp heat of the Liver and Gallbladder; and regulates menstruation. Energetic pathways (Wood tonifies fire): Fire Master tonifies the mother to build the child. Whether we are tonifying the Heart using the Liver, or sedating a Heart excess using the Stomach meridian, we never use points found on the Heart meridian. My teacher, Dr. Lee, described the Heart as a balloon that could be burst with a needle if Heart meridian points were used. (See 55.01 Fire Bag for additional commentary.) Instead, using Tung’s acupuncture, we choose points on either the Jue Yin (PC/LV) channel or the Yang Ming (ST) channel. Worthy of note, Master Tung assigned the Reaction Area of the Heart to both 66.03 Fire Hardness and 66.04 Fire Master. Dr. Lee’s commentary: “One usually drains the Liver, but when the pulse is too slow one must supplement the Liver instead. Liver is the mother of the Heart, supplementing the Liver nourishes its child, the Heart” (Dr. Lee, 1992). See 66.03 Fire Hardness for additional commentary. Blood vessel treating blood vessel: Because both Fire Hardness and Fire Master are over the LV3 Tai Chong artery, they can be used for resuscitation, coma, and other emergency heart situations, such as heart muscle spasm or spasm of the coronary vessels. They are also chosen for heart numbness (uneasiness in the chest), which often occurs during the menstrual period of a patient who has deficiency cold with a slow, unsteady, irregular or skipping heartbeat. The Liver and Pericardium, both Jue Yin, have a very powerful influence on the blood. In classical TCM it is said that the Liver governs and stores the blood, while the Pericardium imprints the emotions on the blood22. For these reasons, the Pericardium efficiently treats both deficient and excess heart-related conditions that are either physical or psychological. Energetic pathways (fire and earth): In Tung’s acupuncture, the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC) share a special relationship that is useful in the treatment of excess heart-related issues. One of the most significant Tung’s point patterns utilizing this relationship is 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle for angina or heart attack. Two other examples of this relationship are 55.01 Fire Bag for heart attack and PC6 with ST36 (Old Doctors’ Two Old Needles) to treat coronary heart disease. Energetic pathways (wood/wind): Fire Master treats headaches, hypertension, dizziness, epilepsy, or nosebleeds related to excess Liver disease. It is the earth point on a wood channel, capable of subduing endogenous wind and hyperactivity of the liver, extinguishing draft and calming spasm. ",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: As the wood point of the Stomach meridian, 66.05 Golden Gate harmonizes wood within the earth, soothes the Liver, releases the Spleen, and regulates Liver, Spleen and Stomach. Needled close to the bone, Golden Gate also activates the Kidney. When the word “Gold” appears in the name of a point, it refers to metal and therefore Lung and Large Intestine. In this case, it refers to both; there is an internal/external relationship between the Lung and Large Intestine here, as well as a connection between the Hand and Foot Yang Ming channels (LI/ST), which lend the function of profoundly tonifying earth to build metal. •  Diagnostics: When needled correctly, this point can serve a diagnostic purpose: if opposite-side abdominal pain does not lessen immediately upon insertion, the origin of the pain is likely reproductive or urinary.•  Abdominal pain: Food stagnation creates a lot of accumulated gas and therefore discomfort. Via palpation, we can assess the severity and location of the condition. Holding one hand on top of the other, palpate the patient’s entire abdomen with the flat surface of your fingers to gently ascertain painful pockets of gas, inflammation, adhesions or scar tissue. Do not palpate by touching your skin to theirs, as this causes unnecessary stimulation. Everything you need to learn can be felt through clothing or a thin blanket. Palpation is impossible over a belt or buckle. Patients with abdominal distension, gas or bloating usually experience pain bilaterally, though one side may be worse. If this is the case, I start by treating the least painful side first, needling ST43 on the opposite side using a thumb-back sedation technique (see below). I can relieve discomfort within thirty seconds – more quickly than I can return to check the belly again. •  Thumb-back sedation technique: In order to sedate on the Stomach channel, use your right hand to needle the patient’s left foot, or your left hand to needle the patient’s right foot. Gripping the needle firmly with qi, rotate it by pulling your thumb backward, then gently roll the needle forward and firmly pull back again with qi, six times in total. •  Note: You must learn to use both hands to successfully apply tonification or sedation needle techniques, because the energy of the body is flowing out, around, and back up. It is easy to imagine this flow of energy when using the analogy of an apple cut on a vertical plane. Once you have mastered the technique, it will become second nature to you. Sedating on the Stomach channel is the same as on the Gallbladder and Urinary Bladder channels; moving thumb forward on these three channels will tonify. Most acupuncture points in Tung’s system are needled with strong stimulation and a neutral needle rotation.•  Recheck the abdomen: After applying the thumb-back sedation technique, I re-check the abdomen on the side opposite the needle. Upon palpation, if the sensitivity is less than eighty percent better, I sedate again in the same manner. •  Switch to the other side: When the abdominal sensitivity has improved more than eighty percent, I remove the needle, then needle Golden Gate on the opposite foot. Switching hands, I repeat the thumb-back sedation technique on the side opposite the worst abdominal pain. •  Note: It is very important to keep your eyes on the patient’s eyes during the process of needle rotation, because the tip of the needle is likely to catch a small muscle fiber and twist it, causing severe pain. Watching the patient’s eyes, you will spot their involuntary blink as a response to the pain; at this point, stop and minutely traction up or down (raising or inserting the needle tip the tiniest amount), and then begin rotating the needle again before the patient can say, “Ouch.” Though this method of sedation sounds complicated, it is actually quite simple and has a profound effect. If you were to tonify (thumb forward), the patient’s abdominal pain would increase. •  Adding additional needles: After clearing both sides of the abdomen using unilateral needling of Golden Gate, retain the last needle for the duration of the treatment and add 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) and antique PC6 Nei Guan (3.0 cun above the wrist crease). This simple treatment is by far my favorite way to address even the most stubborn cases of IBS or Crohn’s disease, not to mention indigestion, diarrhea, gas or bloating.•  Paralytic colon: The treatment outlined above can be used when bowel sounds are not forthcoming after surgery. When the intestine does not “wake up” after anesthesia,residual toxins in the intestine begin to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, causing severe nausea and dry heaves. Because the patient has not eaten since the night before surgery, there is nothing to vomit. To relieve nausea immediately, bleed 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU16). It is usually adequate to release a small amount of blood, but the blood must be squeezed out from the puncture site. After thirty to sixty seconds, the patient usually reports their stomach dropping or relaxing. (See 1010.07 All Pivot for further information.) Continue squeezing and swiping for at least ten drops beyond the relaxing of the stomach. Then needle Golden Gate, 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) and antique PC6 Nei Guan (3.0 cun above the wrist crease). Usually within a few hours of this treatment, bowel sounds are heard and the patient can go home.•  Bowel diseases: To treat indigestion, diarrhea, gas or bloating, I most commonly use Golden Gate in the combination shown above. However, Golden Gate is capable of much more. It has been my primary treatment in cases with adhesions and chronic post-surgical pain from resected bowels due to Crohn’s disease. Chronic diseases always imply Kidney weakness, and Golden Gate needled close to the bone (proximal to Textbook ST43, higher up on the dorsum of the foot) is very useful in treating cock’s crow diarrhea, which is always due to Kidney yang deficiency. In combination with SP4 and PC6, it is highly effective for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic food allergies, although the allergen must also be removed from the diet. These cases often involve a toxic headache, which also responds to the needling of Golden Gate.•  Pineapple heals intestines: I remember Dr. Lee giving nearly every patient with intestinal disorders instructions to eat two small cans of pineapple every day for at least three months. She said pineapple could even heal colon cancer, and that it would clean out (even scrub) pockets of debris within the intestines. After five to ten days of eating pineapple, patients may see black material mixed in with their stool, indicating old fecal matter is being expelled. •  Caution: If you palpate any kind of abdominal mass that you cannot identify, do not hesitate to refer the patient to their Western doctor.•  Migraine headache: Golden Gate is a wood Shu-Stream point on an earth channel (wind and damp), making it perfect for harmonizing Liver and Spleen (wood attacking earth). For this reason, it is frequently used for migraine headache in the Tai Yang (Extra Point) area, menstrual cramping, irritability or TMJ when these are related to Liver qi stagnation. If the headache is cyclic, implying hormonal imbalance, I am likely to add 11.17 Wood (Anger), 11.06 Return to the Nest, and 11.24 Gynecological Points. As a Shu-Point, Golden Gate is good for TMJ and joint pain, but if the headache is related to tight tendons in the neck, I am likely to use 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles, adding Golden Gate if there is nausea and vomiting. For a patient with chronic migraines, I usually cup the neck and shoulders to open blood flow through the neck and head. These cup marks are always black or extremely dark. Be sure to include the area directly behind the ear (SJ17). •  Tai Yang area bleeding for migraine: In a bleeding class I taught, a student with constant, chronic migraines volunteered for a demonstration of Tai Yang (Extra Point) area bleeding. Because more than one person in the class wanted the experience of having Tai Yang bled, I bled only the right side on this particular volunteer. Six weeks later, he emailed that he hadn’t had a headache since the treatment. Bleeding any available vein in the vicinity of Tai Yang (Extra Point) often resolves chronic migraines with one treatment. Be sure the vessel you are bleeding does not have a pulse; find the artery easily located in the temple area and avoid it.•  Case history (migraine, Dr. Lee): “An eleven-year-old girl was brought by her mother to my office. She left school with an intense migraine headache. The child was crying very badly due to the pain. I put her on the treatment bed and needled this point. She dried her eyes and said that her pain was gone. Then she looked down at her foot and saw the needle. While the pain was bad, she did not even feel or know anything about the needle. But when the pain was gone, seeing the needle she became frightened and began to cry again. I asked her if she would rather have her headache. The little girl smiled and asked her mother if she could return to the party they were having at school. This little girl was pubescent and the headache was associated with the changes initiated by puberty. This point can provide great relief for such cases. It can stop the nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Only one needle, easy to use. I use this point a great deal” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Dao Ma: Dr. Young recommends combining Golden Gate with ST44 Nei Ting as a Dao Ma to make Golden Gate even more effective (Dr. Young, 2008). •  Nasal congestion: Though I never use Golden Gate specifically for sinusitis, it is useful when food allergies cause nasal obstruction. If I am treating a patient for some kind of intestinal distress and their sinuses clear, it may be related to this point. Tung’s system has many options for treating congested sinuses; my favorite is LI20 Welcome Fragrance, superficially needled toward Yin Tang (for needling instruction, see 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance). However, because Golden Gate relates to metal, and metal relates to Lung and Large Intestine, this point can open the nose and resolve blocked sinuses. ",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Some sources claim the Liver meridian has a branch to the middle toe; for that pathway, Wood Keep would be the Ying-Spring point and Wood Scoop would be the Shu-Stream point. These points treat diseases related to qi, blood, muscles and tendons because the Stomach channel is full of qi and blood, the Liver stores the blood and governs tendons, and the Spleen controls blood and governs qi and muscles (Dr. Young, 2008). I relate these points to a Gallbladder channel collateral pathway and always needle Wood Keep and Wood Scoop together, as a Dao Ma, to regulate qi and blood. They are located between the Stomach and Gallbladder meridians (earth and wood); therefore, they treat Spleen and Liver disharmony and associated diseases. Because of the connection to the Foot Shao Yang (GB) channel, indications like trigeminal neuralgia, earache, and stiff neck can be treated. Trigger finger: My favorite use of these points is in the treatment of opposite-side pain or trigger finger affecting the middle or ring finger (Pericardium). Jue Yin (PC/LV) treats tendons and ligaments, and it can be reached through the special relationship between the Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST), the Gallbladder/Liver internal/external connection, and the shared meridian pathway of the Liver/ Pericardium. The neck and shoulders can also be treated through all of the above connections. Neuroma: These are also my favorite points for treating opposite-side neuromas. I have found that neuromas do not like to be disturbed with needles, Tui Na massage, moxa or bleeding. Local treatment always has negative results, but opposite-side needling is safe and effective. When neuromas form, they are always in this space between the third and fourth metatarsals and rarely on both sides of the body. Blood diseases: Wood Keep and Wood Scoop build blood and may be used to treat any kind of leukemia (Heart/Spleen/Liver), anemia, and clotting disorders (both excess and deficient). However, they may be most effective in the treatment of leucopenia. For blood diseases, always treat the Liver and Spleen; it is also important to consider 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows and 77.05-77.07 Three Weights.

In TCM, it is said to move Liver qi and benefit the eyes and breasts, and it is frequently used for foot pain. As a Shu-Stream point, it treats heavy and aching joints, even nerve pain; for this reason, I use it most as a Guiding Point on the affected side when treating Gallbladder channel sciatica. As a wood point on a wood channel, needled alongside the bone and lateral to the tendon, it tonifies Liver and Kidney, eliminates wind and relaxes tight tendons and muscles. Because Shao Yang controls bones, when this point is needled alongside the bone it can be used to treat wind- and damp-related bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and pain in the joints and bones of the whole body (bone-treating-bone function). With the Reaction Areas of both Lung and Kidney, this point has the word “Water” in its name, indicating a relationship to dispersing fluids as well as a further connection to the Kidney, more specifically to poor kidney function resulting in damp conditions such as edema, obesity, abdominal distension, lower back pain, and gynecological issues. Dai Mai: Because Water Curve is the Master Point of the Dai Mai, when we use it in conjunction with SJ5 Wai Guan and/or A.04 San Cha Three, it can treat lower back, waist and leg pain. Obesity: Moxa can be used on Water Curve to treat life-threatening or extreme obesity; however, do not abuse it for ordinary weight loss. ",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Fire Chrysanthemum was one of Master Tung’s favorites to clear the head and eyes. Like its namesake herb, Ju Hua (Chrysanthemum), Fire Chrysanthemum clears heat in the head, improving vision. It is similar to SP4 Gong Sun but is needled even closer to the bone, lending a stronger Kidney tonification function. “Fire” in the point name indicates a relationship to the Heart. Fire Chrysanthemum regulates the Heart and Kidney (fire and water) to resolve excess fire. It is the Luo-Connecting point of the Spleen channel and the Master Point of the Chong Mai (Sea of Blood). Abdomen and chest: 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43) with Fire Chrysanthemum and PC6 Nei Guan25 is my favorite treatment for abdominal distension, gas and bloating, diarrhea, irritable bowel, and Crohn’s disease; this treatment utilizes the deeper Kidney points of the Chong Mai. To treat digestive or abdominal issues, first needle  I always needle the antique location of PC6 Nei Guan, found 3.0 cun proximal to the wrist crease. Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) and then PC6 Nei Guan. When Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) is treated first, the treatment is directed to the lower abdomen. PC6 Nei Guan sedates the Liver, treating Liver qi attacking the Stomach due to anger and anxiety. If I am treating anxiety-related chest pain, heaviness or palpitations, I first needle PC6 Nei Guan (Master Point of the Yin Wei Mai) and then Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) in order to direct the treatment to the chest. Additionally, I usually add the Prefrontal Scalp Points. Paralytic colon: The treatment outlined above can be used when bowel sounds are not forthcoming after surgery. When the intestine does not “wake up” after anesthesia, residual toxins in the intestine begin to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, causing severe nausea and dry heaves. Because the patient has not eaten since the night before surgery, there is nothing to vomit. To relieve nausea immediately, bleed 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU16). It is usually adequate to release a small amount of blood, but the blood must be squeezed out from the puncture site. After thirty to sixty seconds, the patient usually reports their stomach dropping or relaxing. Continue squeezing and swiping for at least ten drops beyond the relaxing of the stomach. Then needle Golden Gate, 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) and antique PC6 Nei Guan (3.0 cun above the wrist crease). Usually within a few hours of this treatment, bowel sounds are heard and the patient can go home. See 1010.07 All Pivot for further information related to paralytic colon. Diagnostics: Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) is very good for abdominal pain. If the pain goes away, it is a functional problem such as indigestion, gas, bloating, constipation, etc. If the pain comes back, it may be a serious gastrointestinal organ problem (cancer, perforated ulcer, bowel obstruction); in this case, the patient needs to see their Western medical physician, especially if you palpate any unidentifiable mass. Do not scare the patient unnecessarily; refer them to a physician without voicing your suspicions. Deficient frontal headache: When frontal headaches occur due to an excess condition, treat the Stomach channel; but for a deficient-type headache, choose from Spleen channel points such as 66.11 (SP4), 77.17 Heaven Emperor (SP9), and/or 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan). See 77.18 Shen Guan and 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) for additional information related to the diagnosis and treatment of both deficient and excess type frontal headaches. Blood-deficient headaches: Because SP4 is the Master Point of the Chong Mai, it is used to treat blood-deficient headaches. Floaters and heavy eyelids: With A.04 San Cha Three and 66.05 Golden Gate, Fire Chrysanthemum is useful in the treatment of heavy eyelids (inability to keep the eyes open) and floaters. When the visual field includes one or two floaters, it is not of great concern; however, a plethora of floaters can be a precursor or an indication of a detaching retina. If the patient also sees flashing lights in the darkness, begin treatment using 55.02 Flower Bone One immediately, for detaching retina (see 55.02 Flower Bone One). A detached retina is extremely serious and can lead to blindness. Western medical intervention is extreme, as a laser is used to create multiple small scars (often two hundred or more) that attach the retina to the back of the eyeball. I have treated this condition very successfully numerous times using Flower Bone One. I am reluctant to refer such a patient to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis, because the patient will be frightened into the more radical surgical procedure. In my opinion, it is far more beneficial to strengthen the anatomy of the eye so that the retina naturally reattaches than to introduce scarring in an eye that is already weak and compromised. 241 Foot and Ankle Points Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia: Hypertension is a wind and phlegm condition that can be caused by high cholesterol or arteriosclerosis. 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) and Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) are used together to disperse phlegm and open the blood vessels. Four Flower Outer lowers cholesterol because it is the Stomach Luo point for phlegm; TCM considers cholesterol as a type of phlegm. Stiff neck and high cholesterol are often related. Dr. Young’s treatment for promoting weight loss: For issues of weight loss, phlegm and fat, needle the following combination: REN4 Guan Yuan, SI4 Wan Gu, Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4), 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) and ST34 Liang Qiu. REN4 is the Mu point of the Small Intestine channel and is good for absorption. SI4 drains dampness. SP4 and ST40 eliminate phlegm and fat, and ST34 suppresses the appetite. Dr. Young also recommends eating lots of apples. Finger numbness: Finger numbness can be caused by cholesterol, hypertension, pharmaceutical side effects or cervical bone spurring. It is important to determine the cause of the problem. Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) is useful in treating numbness related to high cholesterol and hypertension. Pregnancy: Master Tung suggested that 66.10 Fire Connection, 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum and 66.12 Fire Scatter were forbidden to needle during pregnancy; however, Dr. Young tells us to avoid only 66.12 Fire Scatter (Tung’s KD2).

It tonifies Kidney yang and nourishes Kidney yin, strengthening the lower back and clearing deficient fire. It also tonifies the Spleen and benefits the Lungs. As an earth point on a water channel, needled close to the tendon (wood), the point has Spleen, Kidney and Liver influences, making it very useful in treating symptoms related to hypertension, head and eye diseases (Liver); brain, spine and vertebrae (Kidney); and digestive and metabolic disorders such as diabetes, proteinuria, floating edema, nausea and vomiting (Spleen and Kidney).

For weak patients, needle in a prone or sideway position. This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Point Location and Needling Technique, and on the Eastern Currents webinar platform that houses my series of beginning and advanced classes. The Correct Tendons video includes three demonstrations of the location and needling of these points. Learning these points may be challenging, but I include them among my favorites of Master Tung’s points, and their usefulness in treating neck and head injuries is unsurpassed. Dao Ma: 77.01 Upright Tendon and 77.02 Upright Ancestry are always needled together (Point Coupling) in the combination known as Correct Tendons. Two additional points – 77.03 Upright Scholar and 77.04 Catching Ball (Tung’s UB57) – are rarely used, because 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons are remarkably powerful and need no further Dao Ma. Needle gauge/length: The Correct Tendons points are the second-most difficult set of points to execute in Tung’s system (second only to 55.02 Flower Bone One) because needling them requires inserting a long, thin needle through the Achilles tendon, the thickest tendon in the body. With practice, it is easily accomplished. Using a larger gauge needle would be easier but far more painful for the patient, so I highly recommend practicing until perfecting the use of a 0.20 x 50mm (Japanese gauge 3, Chinese gauge 36) needle for these points. During the incremental insertion of the needle shaft, one millimeter at a time, the practitioner may at first experience their fingers slipping on the shaft until they have learned to grasp the needle with qi. It is impossible to insert these needles into the Achilles tendon without touching the shaft, and it also would be impossible while holding the needle with a sterile cotton ball; therefore, practitioners may choose to wear sterile gloves when needling these points. Because bone treats bone, and these needles are used specifically for anomalies along the spine, gently tap the bone to enhance the Kidney tonification effect. Unless the patient is under five feet tall, 40mm length needles are not long enough to gently tap the back of the tibia. For most patients, a 50mm needle will suffice; however, patients taller than six feet may require a 60mm needle. If the needle does not tap the bone, you must determine whether the needle is too short or whether it missed the back of the tibia and slid to one side or the other. See the paragraph that begins, “Gently tapping the back of the tibia,” below. Patient positioning: Because I primarily use Correct Tendons to treat a variety of neck injuries, I have found it necessary to position my patients in various ways so that they can be comfortable, including: face down on the table, face up on the table, lying on their side, or sitting in a chair. Because these points are some of the most difficult to needle, I would advise a practitioner who is practicing their insertion for the first few times to begin with the patient lying face down, with their head resting in a face cradle. When the patient is in this position, their legs are stabilized and the direction of your needling is supported by gravity. Primary position, face down: Always use a face cradle when needling these points on a patient who is lying face down, because anyone with a neck injury should neither turn nor lift their head. Active Qi Moving technique is not recommended, as the weight of the head would further injure the neck. Place a pillow under their ankles and dorsal feet so that their toes are slightly elevated off the table and completely relaxed. The pillow under the ankles allows the legs and lumbar vertebrae to relax, as well. Next, see the paragraph that begins, “Massage the tendon,” below (this step cannot be overemphasized). Side position: If a patient cannot lie on their stomach with their head in a face cradle, these points can be needled with the patient lying on their side. This position might be preferable for many patients; however, it is extremely difficult for an inexperienced needler of Correct Tendons. When the patient is lying on their side, the practitioner is required to insert fine needles through a heavy tendon using only one hand, because the other hand needs to stabilize the anterior tibia in order to prevent it from sliding on the table. Practice is essential, as learning to grip the needle with qi is necessary for inserting in this position. With the patient lying on their side, place one or two pillows under their head and neck (not under the shoulder), so the head is perfectly perpendicular to the shoulders and not tipped toward the table or ceiling. Adjust the pillows to be sure that the shoulder contacting the table is comfortable. In order to remove the twist from the lumbar vertebrae, have the patient straighten their bottom leg and bend their top leg, and place a large pillow under their bent knee. Now use rolled hand towels to prop both Achilles tendons in a perfectly relaxed position. To best accomplish this, fold two hand towels in half lengthwise and roll them together; place the large roll under the medial ankle and arch of the top foot, rolling the towel back and forth and thereby rotating the foot toward the table and the ceiling, until the Achilles tendon is in a neutral position. Fold a third hand towel in half lengthwise, making a small roll, and place it under the bottom ankle, again rolling it forward and back until the tendon and the bottom foot are perfectly suspended and relaxed. Be careful not to allow the bottom foot to extend off the table, as that would cause it to become icy cold during the treatment. Using the hand towel to suspend the foot on the table is necessary because otherwise, with the Urinary Bladder channel contacting the table, the foot would be pushed toward the ceiling, putting pressure on the Achilles tendon. For comfortable insertion, it is essential that the tendon is utterly relaxed. Next, see the paragraph that begins, “Massage the tendon,” below. Face-up position: On one occasion, I treated a rugby coach who had broken his neck in a scrum. He was sporting a plastic neck brace that screwed into his skull, and he was unable to lie face down or on his side. Sitting in a chair was also uncomfortable for him, so I had to be creative. With pillows at the right height under his head, he lay down on the table, face up, with his ankles hanging off the end and a bolster under his knees. I then had to lie on the floor and needle upwards through the Achilles tendons, which worked well. However, I would never recommend this type of insertion for a practitioner new to Correct Tendons. Sitting position: As a child, I frequently saw my aunt in a traction device due to severe arthritis in her neck. Correct Tendons altogether eliminated her need for this device. Because she was unable to comfortably lie face down, face up, or on either side, I taught myself to needle Correct Tendons while she sat in a straight chair (with arm rests), with a small pillow behind her lumbar spine and her feet flat on the floor (wearing open-back shoes or flip-flops). Because every Correct Tendons needling position necessitates that the legs be completely relaxed, a sitting position requires the legs to remain parallel so that the Achilles tendons are perfectly neutral. To help the patient comfortably retain this position for the duration of the treatment, it is necessary to tie a belt or strap around the thighs (approximately 4-6 inches above the knees, to avoid knee strain) so that they can relax their legs. Sit on the floor in front of the patient and firmly but briefly massage the calves and Achilles tendons. Using your mind’s eye to guide your fingers, palpate the flat surface of the Achilles tendon in relation to the malleoli and insert the needles through the tendon toward the back of tibia until you feel a gentle bone tap. This position is by far the most difficult for needling Correct Tendons, but with patience and practice you will be successful. Massage the tendon: The Correct Tendons points are infinitely easier to needle if you first quickly but deeply massage the gastrocnemius muscle and Achilles tendon. Forgetting to do this one thing will basically cause torture for your patient and extreme frustration for you. With the patient lying face down, bend the knee of one leg at a time. When the right knee is bent, use your left forearm to flex the patient’s foot forward and back, holding their heel in your left palm and pushing down on their foot with your forearm across their plantar surface. While stretching the foot and Achilles in this manner, use the web between your right thumb and index fingers to deeply press the Achilles tendon against the back of their tibia for 15-30 seconds; do this in several different areas of the tendon, especially just above the Achilles insertion on the calcaneus bone. Then place the leg back on the table, and firmly, quickly massage both heads of the gastrocnemius muscle and the Achilles tendon again. This process should take only a couple of minutes. Then switch to the other leg. The Achilles is ready to be needled only after this massage. Women who wear high heels will want to stretch their legs thoroughly before the treatment described above. Flat surface of the Achilles tendon: It is very interesting (and essential) to note that in most patients, the Achilles tendon is not straight; instead it angles either laterally or medially. This is because the tendon, which is attached to the gastrocnemius muscle, veers according to the structure of the bones beneath it (primarily the tibia, as the fibula is a floating bone). In order to insert a needle so that its tip gently taps the back of the tibia, one must precisely locate the flat surface of the Achilles tendon. On some people’s calves, the Achilles tendon is obvious, whereas on others, the surrounding muscle may obscure it unless you press down on either side of it with both of your index fingers. Palpating the tendon in this manner shows you not only the tendon’s overall direction but also its width. As you move proximally toward the location of the second point, you will notice that the tendon flares as you approach the gastrocnemius. When needling Correct Tendons, we want our point location to be in the exact center of the width of the tendon, and our needle trajectory to be perfectly perpendicular to its flat surface. In most cases, because the tendon veers to one side or the other, the flat top of the tendon is not horizontal. I suggest using a guide tube, which allows you to firmly tap the needle into the tendon and also shows the perpendicular placement of the needle in the middle of the angled tendon. This determines and sets the trajectory of the needle, which is held by the tendon itself. Once the needle has been tapped, the only way to change this trajectory is to lift the tip of the needle out of the tendon to a position just beneath the skin. When the needle is “loose,” it can be repegged into the tendon again. Repegging the tendon is an important step that ensures a trajectory, which results in the gentle tapping of the back of the tibia. To confirm that the trajectory is correct, once you have tapped the needle in and removed the tube, use the tube to hold the needle erect. If it appears that the shaft of the needle is perfectly straight, and there are no tiny folds of skin around the needle (indicating an imperfect trajectory), you may proceed with your needle insertion (see directions below). If the shaft of your needle is not perfectly perpendicular to the flat top of the tendon (keeping in mind that the flat surface of the tendon may be at an angle), it is necessary to repeg the tendon in order to correct not only your insertion but also your trajectory, because the projection of an improperly placed needle will become greater and greater as the needle reaches its full depth. If you are using a 0.20 x 50mm needle and you do not feel the bone tap on the back of the tibia, you may have missed the back of the tibia altogether; in this case, it is necessary to determine which side of the tibia the needle has slid down. Contacting the periosteum on either the medial or lateral side of the tibia has a particular sensation and can be bad for the bone (see the paragraph that begins, “Needle sensation,” below). Use the crease: When locating 77.01 Upright Tendon, the more distal of the two points, place your index fingers on both the medial and lateral malleoli. Now, bring both fingers to the top of the tendon and notice that your lateral finger is approximately one cun distal to your medial one. If there is a significant crease in the skin on top of the tendon between your two fingers, you may choose to needle through that crease as it is already desensitized. However, it is not at all necessary to choose a crease; any point between your two fingers will work, because the location of the Correct Tendons points does not need to be exact. Just be sure to avoid any blood vessels that you can feel on top of the Achilles tendon; you may be able to see them, but they will slip around on top of the tendon when palpated. Needling through these blood vessels is painful, and it may damage the vessel. I experienced this when these points were repeatedly needled on me; many years later, this vessel is still enlarged with scar tissue and sensitive. Inserting the needle: With the patient lying face down in a face cradle, and a pillow elevating their toes slightly off the table, massage their calves as directed above. Standing on the side of the table, place the palm of your hand that is closest to the patient’s feet very gently over the heel of their foot. This hand position is to simply balance your body without putting any weight whatsoever on the patient’s foot. This same hand will incrementally insert the needle into the tendon, one millimeter at a time, once the needle has been tapped, checked, and confirmed as properly placed (see above). With your opposite hand, grasp the shaft of the needle, and while balancing this hand weightlessly against the patient’s gastrocnemius with your little finger, begin to apply downward pressure to the needle while it is incrementally inserted into the tendon. Once the Achilles tendon has been fully penetrated, there will be a discernable density change. Continue needle insertion until you very gently tap the back of the tibia. Gently tapping the back of the tibia: Patients feel even the most subtle bone tap, so anticipate it carefully to avoid plowing into the bone and damaging the periosteum (the bone’s protective layer). If you use a needle of the appropriate length (see above) but no bone tap is felt (a “donk,” as if against stone), then the needle has slid down on one side of the tibia or the other, and you need to determine which side it is. Sliding the needle shaft alongside the tibia may produce a slight electrical sensation that wraps around the tibia; this is not particularly uncomfortable for the patient, but it indicates incorrect needle placement and is unhealthy for the periosteum. If this occurs, or if you miss the bone tap, you need to remove the needle from the tendon (to just beneath the skin) and repeg it to correct the trajectory. Missing the bone tap indicates incorrect placement and does not provide a good therapeutic result. Needle sensation: When these points are needled correctly, most patients describe the needling sensation with words such as “thick,” rather than “painful.” If your needle insertion is painful, the needle gauge is probably too large, and you need to practice wielding a finer needle. Because these points are so powerful, being needled through the strongest tendon in the entire body, insertion alone is enough and no stimulation is required. Some patients experience a subtle sensation of qi moving through the legs and lower body quickly, somewhat slowing down through the lumbar spine, picking up speed through the thoracic vertebrae and then “slugging out” in the cervical spine before ascending up and over the head into the eyes. For this reason, I ask the patient (if they are awake) to mentally picture keeping their spine open, in order for the energy to pass through as easily as possible. Most people do not experience the subtleties of this sensation and shortly fall sound asleep. Retention: Because the qi has a long way to travel from one end of the body to the other, it is best to retain these needles for sixty minutes. The preferred position for needling Correct Tendons is face down, with the head resting in a face cradle. Patients need to be forewarned that their sinuses will always congest in this position; otherwise, they will become concerned about having contracted a common cold or flu from the face cradle. Beneath the face cradle, I always place a chair where the patient can rest their arms and, when necessary, reach for a box of Kleenex or ring a bell to get my attention. If a patient has lower back pain, the lengthy time in a facedown position may exacerbate the pain, even though their lower back will also benefit as the qi passes through on the way to the head, strengthening the entire spine. After removing the needles, I always have the patient turn over and rest with a bolster under their knees for at least five minutes. Make sure they do not cross their ankles and they let their sacrum gently settle into the table, straightening all their vertebrae up to the neck. If their lower back is uncomfortable, quickly needle KD3 Tai Xi bilaterally and retain for ten minutes. When they get up, their back will feel fine. I ask my patients to thoroughly stretch their calves and Achilles tendons before they go to bed that night and again the next morning, to alleviate any lingering tightness or tenderness in the tendon. Needling frequency: For best clinical results in severe cases, I have found that it is better to needle Correct Tendons three times in two weeks rather than once per week for three weeks. The decreased interval between treatments can make a big difference. Usually within two to three treatments, there is a significant improvement, though continued treatment may be required to complete recovery. Depth: 1.5-2.0 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Correct Tendons points are located on the back of the Achilles tendon between the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians, and they have the Reaction Areas of Brain and Spine. Upright Tendon is located between UB60 Kun Lun and KD3 Tai Xi. Before humans evolved to walk on two legs, the spine was the highest part of the body, and Mount Kun Lun represents this “highest mountain.” Both UB60 and Correct Tendons treat the spine and are especially effective for occipital headaches, whiplash, concussion, and brain diseases. Because Correct Tendons are needled deeply through the Achilles tendon to gently tap the back of the tibia, they activate both the tendon-treating-tendon and bone-treating-bone systems. Needling through this large tendon makes them also useful for treating spasms anywhere in the body, including spasms from menstrual cramping and plantar fasciitis. Tapping the bone enhances the function of Kidney tonification because it relates to the brain, spine and bone marrow. Correct Tendons regulates the qi either by raising the yang to warm the entire body or by descending excess yang qi and dispersing wind from the head and spine. Neck and head: The Correct Tendons point pattern is among my top five favorites in Tung’s acupuncture because it is clinically outstanding for any disease involving the cervical spine, occipital area or cerebellum. Interestingly, is it said that if the Achilles tendon is cut, the head cannot be held erect. These points are my first choice for head and neck injuries such as whiplash, concussion, neck pain or stiffness (including protruding or herniated discs and stenosis), occipital headaches, and intracranial injury or disease. Correct Tendons points are so powerful that it is rarely necessary to add any other points; however, I often cup the entire upper back and neck before needling these points. Lumbar spine: Correct Tendons adjusts misalignment all the way up the spine, so when there are lumbar or thoracic anomalies, they respond to the use of Correct Tendons in the treatment of the head or neck. Although these points can be used for lower back pain, I am likely to choose other points if the patient does not have any head or neck indications, because Master Tung’s system has so many points to choose from. Ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that causes the fusion of the entire spinal column. The slow calcification of the spine gradually causes a bending forward which results in the patient looking only at the ground when walking. It is more commonly found among twenty- to forty-year-old men of Jewish decent; however, I treated two Chinese brothers who had this condition. 271 Lower Leg Points Ankylosing spondylitis can also be the result of interactions of both pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. My mother had this condition from a lifetime of taking aspirin on a daily basis. Treatment: My primary treatment for this condition is bamboo cupping of the entire spine, every two weeks. Bamboo cupping is a bleeding technique that utilizes small sections of bamboo that are boiled and placed over a small puncture made between the posterior spinous processes of the vertebra. The boiled bamboo cups create a suction which draws a small clot of blood from between all the vertebrae, thus vitalizing the blood and preventing further calcification. What is already fused will not unfuse, but you can stop the progression. I have successfully treated three cases using bamboo cupping along with Correct Tendons. Bamboo cupping takes 20-30 minutes, so insert Correct Tendons first, as this will make for a much more efficient treatment. Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that allopathic medicine has not been able to treat successfully. Herbal formulas: I have treated three patients using the formula Kang Gu Zeng Sheng Pien. This formula strengthens qi and yang; tonifies Kidney and Liver; fortifies marrow, tendon and bone; clears damp; relieves pain; and is used specifically for calcification following injury, or in spontaneous multiplicative spondylitis. It is good for tendon pain and numbness, as well as chronic vertebral subluxations and spinal inflammation. Another popular formula is Shen Jin Tong Bi Wan, which dispels wind, cold and damp that invades as the result of an overall deficiency.

Case history (ankylosing spondylitis): A 34-year-old male reported having the constant sensation of a cement block between his shoulder blades, indicative of his thoracic spine beginning to fuse. His lumbar vertebrae had already fused and were no longer painful. Once a week for eighteen months, I needled Correct Tendons, and every other week I bamboo-cupped his entire thoracic and lumbar spine. Within three months, he reported that the heaviness between his shoulder blades was largely gone. By the time we discontinued treatment, he was comfortable and the calcification had stopped. I have treated four other cases with similar results; however his was the most profound, I think because he was the youngest. It is my belief that in all of these cases, without bamboo cupping and Correct Tendons, these patients would have lived their life facing the ground. Case history (severe occipital headache): I was called to the hospital to treat a young man who had been admitted ten days earlier due to a severe occipital headache. His doctor had placed him on an intravenous morphine drip, but this provided him with no relief. First, I did a simple but thorough Gua Sha treatment on the back of his neck, and then I needled Correct Tendons. As soon as the needles were inserted the headache began to recede. The following day, the young man was able to leave the hospital. The doctor and nursing staff were thoroughly impressed. This is the power of Correct Tendons. Case history (chronic neck restriction): One of my patients was an arborist who had been unable to turn her head to either side or move it up and down for more than ten years. Her job was at stake. I began treatment by thoroughly cupping her entire neck and shoulders in a sitting position, in order to cup the musculature without gaps. The cup marks were black. Immediately after cupping she had a fifty percent improvement in the mobility of her neck. I then needled Correct Tendons, retaining the needles for one hour, after which her mobility increased to eighty percent. Despite her marked improvement, when she arrived home, her family convinced her that the cup marks were evidence that she had been abused. This inspired me to create a tri-fold color brochure with photographs of dark cup marks taken on days one, three, five and seven following a thorough cupping session. This brochure explains what to expect during and after cupping therapy. I have shown it to patients before cupping sessions ever since I treated the arborist. Case history (paralysis and coldness, Dr. Lee): “A 22-year-old man had been in a car accident four years before and had broken his neck. He was paralyzed from the neck down and his arms were getting weaker and weaker. All other treatments had failed so he came to see me. Although it was the hot part of summer, he wore a heavy winter jacket. He would also always ask for a glass of warm water to wrap his hands around in an effort to warm them. In addition, he would always ask me to order him a hot meal. When I palpated his neck at DU16 Feng Fu, just below the base of the skull, there was severe pain. This meant that there was still blood stasis that was obstructing the flow of yang qi. I told him he would have to receive three treatments per week. After needling him the first two times at Correct Tendons the sub-occipital pain was lessened. After three treatments he said he could breathe deeper. After the fourth and fifth treatments, he said his whole body felt warmer. A few weeks later, he no longer needed to warm his hands by wrapping them around a hot glass of water” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (severe headache, Dr. Lee): “A 50-year-old woodcutter was knocked down by a tree and his head was shaken backwards violently. After being hospitalized, he still had severe headaches all the time. Each time his physician refilled his pain medication it would be for 100 pills, and his wife had to inject him with morphine every three hours. Over a period of two years, he had five heart attacks due to such heavy pain medication, since it is well known that pain medications affect the heart. Finally a doctor referred him to me with severe insomnia and severe headache. I needled 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons. He then slept, hard. After 45 minutes he awoke and I asked him to gently shake his head. He shook it a little and there was no pain. Then I asked him to shake it more forcefully and still there was no pain. The man stood up. He said he could not believe it. I asked him what he could not believe. He just kept saying he could not believe it. I called his wife into the office and she asked him what he could not believe. He said he could not believe he no longer had a headache. Then she said she could not believe it. I explained to the patient that he should not do any heavy lifting or any heavy work. He left my office and returned home. After sitting around the house for one week, the man grew bored and did some digging in order to plant some flowers. This caused him to get a headache again. He came back to my office and we did several more treatments. Finally, we got rid of all his headaches” (Dr. Lee, 1992).30 Case history (pain in the spine, Dr. Lee): “A patient had pain in every joint of her spine. Correct Tendons points were needled in three subsequent treatments. The first treatment cleared her neck, the second cleared the spine to five inches below her neck, and the third cleared her whole back, and the pain was gone” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (occipital headache, Dr. Lee): “This point is also very effective for the treatment of occipital headache due to past trauma to the back of the head or neck. For instance, this area can be injured if a child has been shaken violently back and forth. Often this will not cause problems when the child is young but may result in occipital headaches when the person is in their late twenties or thirties” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

For weak patients, needle in a prone or sideway position. This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Point Location and Needling Technique, and on the Eastern Currents webinar platform that houses my series of beginning and advanced classes. The Correct Tendons video includes three demonstrations of the location and needling of these points. Learning these points may be challenging, but I include them among my favorites of Master Tung’s points, and their usefulness in treating neck and head injuries is unsurpassed. Dao Ma: 77.01 Upright Tendon and 77.02 Upright Ancestry are always needled together (Point Coupling) in the combination known as Correct Tendons. Two additional points – 77.03 Upright Scholar and 77.04 Catching Ball (Tung’s UB57) – are rarely used, because 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons are remarkably powerful and need no further Dao Ma. Needle gauge/length: The Correct Tendons points are the second-most difficult set of points to execute in Tung’s system (second only to 55.02 Flower Bone One) because needling them requires inserting a long, thin needle through the Achilles tendon, the thickest tendon in the body. With practice, it is easily accomplished. Using a larger gauge needle would be easier but far more painful for the patient, so I highly recommend practicing until perfecting the use of a 0.20 x 50mm (Japanese gauge 3, Chinese gauge 36) needle for these points. During the incremental insertion of the needle shaft, one millimeter at a time, the practitioner may at first experience their fingers slipping on the shaft until they have learned to grasp the needle with qi. It is impossible to insert these needles into the Achilles tendon without touching the shaft, and it also would be impossible while holding the needle with a sterile cotton ball; therefore, practitioners may choose to wear sterile gloves when needling these points. Because bone treats bone, and these needles are used specifically for anomalies along the spine, gently tap the bone to enhance the Kidney tonification effect. Unless the patient is under five feet tall, 40mm length needles are not long enough to gently tap the back of the tibia. For most patients, a 50mm needle will suffice; however, patients taller than six feet may require a 60mm needle. If the needle does not tap the bone, you must determine whether the needle is too short or whether it missed the back of the tibia and slid to one side or the other. See the paragraph that begins, “Gently tapping the back of the tibia,” below. Patient positioning: Because I primarily use Correct Tendons to treat a variety of neck injuries, I have found it necessary to position my patients in various ways so that they can be comfortable, including: face down on the table, face up on the table, lying on their side, or sitting in a chair. Because these points are some of the most difficult to needle, I would advise a practitioner who is practicing their insertion for the first few times to begin with the patient lying face down, with their head resting in a face cradle. When the patient is in this position, their legs are stabilized and the direction of your needling is supported by gravity. Primary position, face down: Always use a face cradle when needling these points on a patient who is lying face down, because anyone with a neck injury should neither turn nor lift their head. Active Qi Moving technique is not recommended, as the weight of the head would further injure the neck. Place a pillow under their ankles and dorsal feet so that their toes are slightly elevated off the table and completely relaxed. The pillow under the ankles allows the legs and lumbar vertebrae to relax, as well. Next, see the paragraph that begins, “Massage the tendon,” below (this step cannot be overemphasized). Side position: If a patient cannot lie on their stomach with their head in a face cradle, these points can be needled with the patient lying on their side. This position might be preferable for many patients; however, it is extremely difficult for an inexperienced needler of Correct Tendons. When the patient is lying on their side, the practitioner is required to insert fine needles through a heavy tendon using only one hand, because the other hand needs to stabilize the anterior tibia in order to prevent it from sliding on the table. Practice is essential, as learning to grip the needle with qi is necessary for inserting in this position. With the patient lying on their side, place one or two pillows under their head and neck (not under the shoulder), so the head is perfectly perpendicular to the shoulders and not tipped toward the table or ceiling. Adjust the pillows to be sure that the shoulder contacting the table is comfortable. In order to remove the twist from the lumbar vertebrae, have the patient straighten their bottom leg and bend their top leg, and place a large pillow under their bent knee. Now use rolled hand towels to prop both Achilles tendons in a perfectly relaxed position. To best accomplish this, fold two hand towels in half lengthwise and roll them together; place the large roll under the medial ankle and arch of the top foot, rolling the towel back and forth and thereby rotating the foot toward the table and the ceiling, until the Achilles tendon is in a neutral position. Fold a third hand towel in half lengthwise, making a small roll, and place it under the bottom ankle, again rolling it forward and back until the tendon and the bottom foot are perfectly suspended and relaxed. Be careful not to allow the bottom foot to extend off the table, as that would cause it to become icy cold during the treatment. Using the hand towel to suspend the foot on the table is necessary because otherwise, with the Urinary Bladder channel contacting the table, the foot would be pushed toward the ceiling, putting pressure on the Achilles tendon. For comfortable insertion, it is essential that the tendon is utterly relaxed. Next, see the paragraph that begins, “Massage the tendon,” below. Face-up position: On one occasion, I treated a rugby coach who had broken his neck in a scrum. He was sporting a plastic neck brace that screwed into his skull, and he was unable to lie face down or on his side. Sitting in a chair was also uncomfortable for him, so I had to be creative. With pillows at the right height under his head, he lay down on the table, face up, with his ankles hanging off the end and a bolster under his knees. I then had to lie on the floor and needle upwards through the Achilles tendons, which worked well. However, I would never recommend this type of insertion for a practitioner new to Correct Tendons. Sitting position: As a child, I frequently saw my aunt in a traction device due to severe arthritis in her neck. Correct Tendons altogether eliminated her need for this device. Because she was unable to comfortably lie face down, face up, or on either side, I taught myself to needle Correct Tendons while she sat in a straight chair (with arm rests), with a small pillow behind her lumbar spine and her feet flat on the floor (wearing open-back shoes or flip-flops). Because every Correct Tendons needling position necessitates that the legs be completely relaxed, a sitting position requires the legs to remain parallel so that the Achilles tendons are perfectly neutral. To help the patient comfortably retain this position for the duration of the treatment, it is necessary to tie a belt or strap around the thighs (approximately 4-6 inches above the knees, to avoid knee strain) so that they can relax their legs. Sit on the floor in front of the patient and firmly but briefly massage the calves and Achilles tendons. Using your mind’s eye to guide your fingers, palpate the flat surface of the Achilles tendon in relation to the malleoli and insert the needles through the tendon toward the back of tibia until you feel a gentle bone tap. This position is by far the most difficult for needling Correct Tendons, but with patience and practice you will be successful. Massage the tendon: The Correct Tendons points are infinitely easier to needle if you first quickly but deeply massage the gastrocnemius muscle and Achilles tendon. Forgetting to do this one thing will basically cause torture for your patient and extreme frustration for you. With the patient lying face down, bend the knee of one leg at a time. When the right knee is bent, use your left forearm to flex the patient’s foot forward and back, holding their heel in your left palm and pushing down on their foot with your forearm across their plantar surface. While stretching the foot and Achilles in this manner, use the web between your right thumb and index fingers to deeply press the Achilles tendon against the back of their tibia for 15-30 seconds; do this in several different areas of the tendon, especially just above the Achilles insertion on the calcaneus bone. Then place the leg back on the table, and firmly, quickly massage both heads of the gastrocnemius muscle and the Achilles tendon again. This process should take only a couple of minutes. Then switch to the other leg. The Achilles is ready to be needled only after this massage. Women who wear high heels will want to stretch their legs thoroughly before the treatment described above. Flat surface of the Achilles tendon: It is very interesting (and essential) to note that in most patients, the Achilles tendon is not straight; instead it angles either laterally or medially. This is because the tendon, which is attached to the gastrocnemius muscle, veers according to the structure of the bones beneath it (primarily the tibia, as the fibula is a floating bone). In order to insert a needle so that its tip gently taps the back of the tibia, one must precisely locate the flat surface of the Achilles tendon. On some people’s calves, the Achilles tendon is obvious, whereas on others, the surrounding muscle may obscure it unless you press down on either side of it with both of your index fingers. Palpating the tendon in this manner shows you not only the tendon’s overall direction but also its width. As you move proximally toward the location of the second point, you will notice that the tendon flares as you approach the gastrocnemius. When needling Correct Tendons, we want our point location to be in the exact center of the width of the tendon, and our needle trajectory to be perfectly perpendicular to its flat surface. In most cases, because the tendon veers to one side or the other, the flat top of the tendon is not horizontal. I suggest using a guide tube, which allows you to firmly tap the needle into the tendon and also shows the perpendicular placement of the needle in the middle of the angled tendon. This determines and sets the trajectory of the needle, which is held by the tendon itself. Once the needle has been tapped, the only way to change this trajectory is to lift the tip of the needle out of the tendon to a position just beneath the skin. When the needle is “loose,” it can be repegged into the tendon again. Repegging the tendon is an important step that ensures a trajectory, which results in the gentle tapping of the back of the tibia. To confirm that the trajectory is correct, once you have tapped the needle in and removed the tube, use the tube to hold the needle erect. If it appears that the shaft of the needle is perfectly straight, and there are no tiny folds of skin around the needle (indicating an imperfect trajectory), you may proceed with your needle insertion (see directions below). If the shaft of your needle is not perfectly perpendicular to the flat top of the tendon (keeping in mind that the flat surface of the tendon may be at an angle), it is necessary to repeg the tendon in order to correct not only your insertion but also your trajectory, because the projection of an improperly placed needle will become greater and greater as the needle reaches its full depth. If you are using a 0.20 x 50mm needle and you do not feel the bone tap on the back of the tibia, you may have missed the back of the tibia altogether; in this case, it is necessary to determine which side of the tibia the needle has slid down. Contacting the periosteum on either the medial or lateral side of the tibia has a particular sensation and can be bad for the bone (see the paragraph that begins, “Needle sensation,” below). Use the crease: When locating 77.01 Upright Tendon, the more distal of the two points, place your index fingers on both the medial and lateral malleoli. Now, bring both fingers to the top of the tendon and notice that your lateral finger is approximately one cun distal to your medial one. If there is a significant crease in the skin on top of the tendon between your two fingers, you may choose to needle through that crease as it is already desensitized. However, it is not at all necessary to choose a crease; any point between your two fingers will work, because the location of the Correct Tendons points does not need to be exact. Just be sure to avoid any blood vessels that you can feel on top of the Achilles tendon; you may be able to see them, but they will slip around on top of the tendon when palpated. Needling through these blood vessels is painful, and it may damage the vessel. I experienced this when these points were repeatedly needled on me; many years later, this vessel is still enlarged with scar tissue and sensitive. Inserting the needle: With the patient lying face down in a face cradle, and a pillow elevating their toes slightly off the table, massage their calves as directed above. Standing on the side of the table, place the palm of your hand that is closest to the patient’s feet very gently over the heel of their foot. This hand position is to simply balance your body without putting any weight whatsoever on the patient’s foot. This same hand will incrementally insert the needle into the tendon, one millimeter at a time, once the needle has been tapped, checked, and confirmed as properly placed (see above). With your opposite hand, grasp the shaft of the needle, and while balancing this hand weightlessly against the patient’s gastrocnemius with your little finger, begin to apply downward pressure to the needle while it is incrementally inserted into the tendon. Once the Achilles tendon has been fully penetrated, there will be a discernable density change. Continue needle insertion until you very gently tap the back of the tibia. Gently tapping the back of the tibia: Patients feel even the most subtle bone tap, so anticipate it carefully to avoid plowing into the bone and damaging the periosteum (the bone’s protective layer). If you use a needle of the appropriate length (see above) but no bone tap is felt (a “donk,” as if against stone), then the needle has slid down on one side of the tibia or the other, and you need to determine which side it is. Sliding the needle shaft alongside the tibia may produce a slight electrical sensation that wraps around the tibia; this is not particularly uncomfortable for the patient, but it indicates incorrect needle placement and is unhealthy for the periosteum. If this occurs, or if you miss the bone tap, you need to remove the needle from the tendon (to just beneath the skin) and repeg it to correct the trajectory. Missing the bone tap indicates incorrect placement and does not provide a good therapeutic result. Needle sensation: When these points are needled correctly, most patients describe the needling sensation with words such as “thick,” rather than “painful.” If your needle insertion is painful, the needle gauge is probably too large, and you need to practice wielding a finer needle. Because these points are so powerful, being needled through the strongest tendon in the entire body, insertion alone is enough and no stimulation is required. Some patients experience a subtle sensation of qi moving through the legs and lower body quickly, somewhat slowing down through the lumbar spine, picking up speed through the thoracic vertebrae and then “slugging out” in the cervical spine before ascending up and over the head into the eyes. For this reason, I ask the patient (if they are awake) to mentally picture keeping their spine open, in order for the energy to pass through as easily as possible. Most people do not experience the subtleties of this sensation and shortly fall sound asleep. Retention: Because the qi has a long way to travel from one end of the body to the other, it is best to retain these needles for sixty minutes. The preferred position for needling Correct Tendons is face down, with the head resting in a face cradle. Patients need to be forewarned that their sinuses will always congest in this position; otherwise, they will become concerned about having contracted a common cold or flu from the face cradle. Beneath the face cradle, I always place a chair where the patient can rest their arms and, when necessary, reach for a box of Kleenex or ring a bell to get my attention. If a patient has lower back pain, the lengthy time in a facedown position may exacerbate the pain, even though their lower back will also benefit as the qi passes through on the way to the head, strengthening the entire spine. After removing the needles, I always have the patient turn over and rest with a bolster under their knees for at least five minutes. Make sure they do not cross their ankles and they let their sacrum gently settle into the table, straightening all their vertebrae up to the neck. If their lower back is uncomfortable, quickly needle KD3 Tai Xi bilaterally and retain for ten minutes. When they get up, their back will feel fine. I ask my patients to thoroughly stretch their calves and Achilles tendons before they go to bed that night and again the next morning, to alleviate any lingering tightness or tenderness in the tendon. Needling frequency: For best clinical results in severe cases, I have found that it is better to needle Correct Tendons three times in two weeks rather than once per week for three weeks. The decreased interval between treatments can make a big difference. Usually within two to three treatments, there is a significant improvement, though continued treatment may be required to complete recovery. Depth: 1.5-2.0 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Correct Tendons points are located on the back of the Achilles tendon between the Urinary Bladder and Kidney meridians, and they have the Reaction Areas of Brain and Spine. Upright Tendon is located between UB60 Kun Lun and KD3 Tai Xi. Before humans evolved to walk on two legs, the spine was the highest part of the body, and Mount Kun Lun represents this “highest mountain.” Both UB60 and Correct Tendons treat the spine and are especially effective for occipital headaches, whiplash, concussion, and brain diseases. Because Correct Tendons are needled deeply through the Achilles tendon to gently tap the back of the tibia, they activate both the tendon-treating-tendon and bone-treating-bone systems. Needling through this large tendon makes them also useful for treating spasms anywhere in the body, including spasms from menstrual cramping and plantar fasciitis. Tapping the bone enhances the function of Kidney tonification because it relates to the brain, spine and bone marrow. Correct Tendons regulates the qi either by raising the yang to warm the entire body or by descending excess yang qi and dispersing wind from the head and spine. Neck and head: The Correct Tendons point pattern is among my top five favorites in Tung’s acupuncture because it is clinically outstanding for any disease involving the cervical spine, occipital area or cerebellum. Interestingly, is it said that if the Achilles tendon is cut, the head cannot be held erect. These points are my first choice for head and neck injuries such as whiplash, concussion, neck pain or stiffness (including protruding or herniated discs and stenosis), occipital headaches, and intracranial injury or disease. Correct Tendons points are so powerful that it is rarely necessary to add any other points; however, I often cup the entire upper back and neck before needling these points. Lumbar spine: Correct Tendons adjusts misalignment all the way up the spine, so when there are lumbar or thoracic anomalies, they respond to the use of Correct Tendons in the treatment of the head or neck. Although these points can be used for lower back pain, I am likely to choose other points if the patient does not have any head or neck indications, because Master Tung’s system has so many points to choose from. Ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that causes the fusion of the entire spinal column. The slow calcification of the spine gradually causes a bending forward which results in the patient looking only at the ground when walking. It is more commonly found among twenty- to forty-year-old men of Jewish decent; however, I treated two Chinese brothers who had this condition. Ankylosing spondylitis can also be the result of interactions of both pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. My mother had this condition from a lifetime of taking aspirin on a daily basis. Treatment: My primary treatment for this condition is bamboo cupping of the entire spine, every two weeks. Bamboo cupping is a bleeding technique that utilizes small sections of bamboo that are boiled and placed over a small puncture made between the posterior spinous processes of the vertebra. The boiled bamboo cups create a suction which draws a small clot of blood from between all the vertebrae, thus vitalizing the blood and preventing further calcification. What is already fused will not unfuse, but you can stop the progression. I have successfully treated three cases using bamboo cupping along with Correct Tendons. Bamboo cupping takes 20-30 minutes, so insert Correct Tendons first, as this will make for a much more efficient treatment. Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that allopathic medicine has not been able to treat successfully. Herbal formulas: I have treated three patients using the formula Kang Gu Zeng Sheng Pien. This formula strengthens qi and yang; tonifies Kidney and Liver; fortifies marrow, tendon and bone; clears damp; relieves pain; and is used specifically for calcification following injury, or in spontaneous multiplicative spondylitis. It is good for tendon pain and numbness, as well as chronic vertebral subluxations and spinal inflammation. Another popular formula is Shen Jin Tong Bi Wan, which dispels wind, cold and damp that invades as the result of an overall deficiency. Other individual ankylosing spondylitis treatment options (given in no specific order): Bleed UB40 Wei Zhong; bilaterally needle 88.12 Bright Yellow. Bilaterally needle 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Middle, 22.06 Zhong Bai (Middle White), 1010.13 Horse Gold Water, 11.12 Er Jiao Ming (Two Corner Bright). Bilaterally needle 88.25-88.27 Three Nine Miles, SI3 Hou Xi. Needled bilaterally 77.09 Four Flower Middle, 77.10 Four Flower Quasi.

Needle DU26 Ren Zhong; bilaterally needle LI11 Qu Chi; moxa UB18-UB20. Bilaterally needle 11.11 Lung Heart. Case history (ankylosing spondylitis): A 34-year-old male reported having the constant sensation of a cement block between his shoulder blades, indicative of his thoracic spine beginning to fuse. His lumbar vertebrae had already fused and were no longer painful. Once a week for eighteen months, I needled Correct Tendons, and every other week I bamboo-cupped his entire thoracic and lumbar spine. Within three months, he reported that the heaviness between his shoulder blades was largely gone. By the time we discontinued treatment, he was comfortable and the calcification had stopped. I have treated four other cases with similar results; however his was the most profound, I think because he was the youngest. It is my belief that in all of these cases, without bamboo cupping and Correct Tendons, these patients would have lived their life facing the ground. Case history (severe occipital headache): I was called to the hospital to treat a young man who had been admitted ten days earlier due to a severe occipital headache. His doctor had placed him on an intravenous morphine drip, but this provided him with no relief. First, I did a simple but thorough Gua Sha treatment on the back of his neck, and then I needled Correct Tendons. As soon as the needles were inserted the headache began to recede. The following day, the young man was able to leave the hospital. The doctor and nursing staff were thoroughly impressed. This is the power of Correct Tendons. Case history (chronic neck restriction): One of my patients was an arborist who had been unable to turn her head to either side or move it up and down for more than ten years. Her job was at stake. I began treatment by thoroughly cupping her entire neck and shoulders in a sitting position, in order to cup the musculature without gaps. The cup marks were black. Immediately after cupping she had a fifty percent improvement in the mobility of her neck. I then needled Correct Tendons, retaining the needles for one hour, after which her mobility increased to eighty percent. Despite her marked improvement, when she arrived home, her family convinced her that the cup marks were evidence that she had been abused. This inspired me to create a tri-fold color brochure with photographs of dark cup marks taken on days one, three, five and seven following a thorough cupping session. This brochure explains what to expect during and after cupping therapy. I have shown it to patients before cupping sessions ever since I treated the arborist. Case history (paralysis and coldness, Dr. Lee): “A 22-year-old man had been in a car accident four years before and had broken his neck. He was paralyzed from the neck down and his arms were getting weaker and weaker. All other treatments had failed so he came to see me. Although it was the hot part of summer, he wore a heavy winter jacket. He would also always ask for a glass of warm water to wrap his hands around in an effort to warm them. In addition, he would always ask me to order him a hot meal. When I palpated his neck at DU16 Feng Fu, just below the base of the skull, there was severe pain. This meant that there was still blood stasis that was obstructing the flow of yang qi. I told him he would have to receive three treatments per week. After needling him the first two times at Correct Tendons the sub-occipital pain was lessened. After three treatments he said he could breathe deeper. After the fourth and fifth treatments, he said his whole body felt warmer. A few weeks later, he no longer needed to warm his hands by wrapping them around a hot glass of water” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (severe headache, Dr. Lee): “A 50-year-old woodcutter was knocked down by a tree and his head was shaken backwards violently. After being hospitalized, he still had severe headaches all the time. Each time his physician refilled his pain medication it would be for 100 pills, and his wife had to inject him with morphine every three hours. Over a period of two years, he had five heart attacks due to such heavy pain medication, since it is well known that pain medications affect the heart. Finally a doctor referred him to me with severe insomnia and severe headache. I needled 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons. He then slept, hard. After 45 minutes he awoke and I asked him to gently shake his head. He shook it a little and there was no pain. Then I asked him to shake it more forcefully and still there was no pain. The man stood up. He said he could not believe it. I asked him what he could not believe. He just kept saying he could not believe it. I called his wife into the office and she asked him what he could not believe. He said he could not believe he no longer had a headache. Then she said she could not believe it. I explained to the patient that he should not do any heavy lifting or any heavy work. He left my office and returned home. After sitting around the house for one week, the man grew bored and did some digging in order to plant some flowers. This caused him to get a headache again. He came back to my office and we did several more treatments. Finally, we got rid of all his headaches” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (pain in the spine, Dr. Lee): “A patient had pain in every joint of her spine. Correct Tendons points were needled in three subsequent treatments. The first treatment cleared her neck, the second cleared the spine to five inches below her neck, and the third cleared her whole back, and the pain was gone” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Case history (occipital headache, Dr. Lee): “This point is also very effective for the treatment of occipital headache due to past trauma to the back of the head or neck. For instance, this area can be injured if a child has been shaken violently back and forth. Often this will not cause problems when the child is young but may result in occipital headaches when the person is in their late twenties or thirties” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Dao Ma: 77.05 First Weight (Chief Point) is needled with Supporting Points 77.06 Second Weight and 77.07 Third Weight in the combination known as 77.05-77.07 Three Weights. These three points are most frequently needled together; however, it should 281 Lower Leg Points be noted that 77.07 Third Weight is similar in location to 77.14 Four Flower Outer/ Textbook ST40 and thus has a stronger influence than First Weight or Second Weight on phlegm. Palpation: When palpating 77.05-77.07 Three Weights, one can feel a pool of energy about the diameter of a pencil eraser. Because these points are easy to feel, I specifically recommend them to students for practicing precise point palpation. With most points in Tung’s system (and these in particular), while I emphasize knowing the exact anatomical location, I always start 0.5 cun above the expected location and then walk my finger downward, palpating for the precise point. In general, it is important to learn how to “feel” acupuncture points. Learn to place your consciousness in the tip of your palpating finger. Do not be discouraged if this takes time, practice and focus. Often the patient will feel when you are on the point, but don’t ask them to tell you where it is, because they might mislead you. Learn to rely on your own palpation by training yourself to feel for the points. Bleeding: Dark veins found in the vicinity of Three Weights are commonly bled to disperse phlegm and blood stagnation. Unilateral vs. bilateral: For one-sided conditions, such as Bell’s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, or pain in a breast, rib, hip, neck or shoulder, needle opposite the affected side. Needle bilaterally to treat systemic diseases and most brain disorders. Direction of stimulation: Almost without exception, when needling these points, we are directing the qi toward the head or the hip, breast, rib or shoulder girdle (including scapula and arm) on the side opposite the pain. For this reason, insert the three needles and then stimulate them distal to proximal (bottom to top). Spleen and liver: For splenomegaly or spleen organ issues, including blood diseases, needle Three Weights on the right side, opposite the spleen. For liver blood diseases, needle either bilaterally or on the left side, opposite the liver organ. Needle sensation: When these needles are inserted, the patient might feel a zing of energy descend down the leg. If the sensation stops at GB40, massage the area extending down the Gallbladder channel and gently tug on the fourth toe or stimulate the needle until the sensation reaches either LV3 or GB41. Do not leave the energy stuck at GB40 or the patient may have difficulty walking when they stand up after the treatment. When Three Weights are needled or even palpated, patients sometimes feel energy movement in their head, as well. Retention: If you are treating the brain, needles should be retained a full hour. Depth: 1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Other names for Three Weights: In the past, the Three Weights points were also called Three Measures or Three Layers. These names are correct and may appear in other written materials. Energetic pathways: The Three Weights points have a profound influence on any disease having to do with wind and phlegm because they are located between the Foot Shao Yang (GB), which dispels wind, and the Foot Yang Ming (ST), which drains dampness. 77.05 First Weight is anterior to GB39, the Meeting Point of Marrow; thus, Three Weights stimulates the production of healthy marrow and blood within the bone. These points are extremely important in influencing the blood, due to the fact that the Liver governs the blood and the Spleen controls the blood, and also due to the internal/external relationships between Liver and Gallbladder, Spleen and Stomach, and the Reaction Areas of Heart, Lung and Spleen. Furthermore, the relationship between the Hand and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB) relates to tendons, ligaments, neck, shoulder, arm, wrist and fingers; this also ties into the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD), influencing bones and brain. Brain: Three Weights treats brain injuries and stroke, in part because the Gallbladder meridian wraps around the head. Widely used with bleeding techniques, these points vitalize the blood by dispersing blood stagnation. They clear the brain and open the orifices by dispersing phlegm and dampness, and they extinguish draft and spasm to restore the brain’s proper motor and sensory functions. Some practitioners report that Three Weights points are more effective for the treatment of functional brain issues than for brain tumors. I have seen good results in the treatment of both functional issues and tumors. Liver organ disease: In cases of serious liver disease, I use 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows with 11.20 Wood Inflammation. However, liver function also improves if I use Three Weights to treat any of the indications listed above. Psychological issues and brain injury: Many psychiatric ailments are actually the result of what Chinese medicine would call “wind and phlegm obstructing the orifices.” This category could include schizophrenia, epilepsy, manic depression, certain types of insomnia and even Alzheimer’s and dementia. Because the Three Weights points have a very powerful ability to circulate blood in the brain, in addition to treating all of the above, they are an excellent choice for the treatment of cerebrovascular events that result in brain damage or deficiencies. Three Weights could be useful in any situation of oxygen depletion to the brain, such as drowning, or brain injury. They should be considered when treating everything from a mild concussion to a severe brain injury, such as frontal lobe impact from a car collision, or for diseases such as encephalitis or hydrocephalus. In these instances, I would consider adding 55.06 Upper Tumor variations. •  Case history (neck arterial occlusion): Because Tung’s system has so many options for treating neck and shoulder pain, and many of them are Gallbladder channel related, I choose to use Three Weights for neck and shoulder issues when there are blood diseases or any symptoms related to the indications for Three Weights. For example, I treated an elderly gentleman with an intravertebral artery that was 100% occluded in his neck. This condition originally caused him to have extreme dizziness and falling incidents. A neurosurgeon said the artery was inoperable because it had become blocked over a period of perhaps 40 years, and if it were surgically cleared, his brain – which had adapted over time to the reduction in blood flow – would be flooded, causing him to die instantly. With treatments including Three Weights, three times weekly for two months, his dizzy spells stopped completely. It is my assumption that this result had to do with the rerouting of the blood supply to his brain. After eighteen months with no episodes, we discontinued treatment with Three Weights to work on his new diagnosis of macular degeneration. Several years later, the macular degeneration is now completely resolved; however, he has begun to experience some dizziness again, as well as signs of dementia. I have begun treatment using 55.02 Flower Bone One to maintain the eyes and Three Weights to clear the brain. Both of these target the head, and so they can be effectively combined, bilaterally. Breast disease: Because ST17 is found on the nipple, and the Gallbladder meridian traverses the side of the breast, opposite-side Three Weights can relieve breast congestion, inflammation and/or tumor. Women who have had surgical procedures often have complications with the lymphatic system, making Three Weights the best choice for treating lymphedema of the arm, due to the wind, phlegm and circulatory influences of these points. Dr. Lee cautioned that for chronic problems such as spleen enlargement and breast cancer, one must be persistent because these conditions cannot be cured easily or quickly. Bleeding dark veins found between the Stomach and Gallbladder channels can be very helpful in reducing swollen and painful breasts.•  Heart and thyroid: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces too little hormone. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces too much hormone. Both can be implicated in heart disease. Hypothyroidism may result in a slow heart rate, a rise in cholesterol, narrowing of the arteries and an increase in fluid surrounding the heart, potentially causing heart failure. Hyperthyroidism causes the heart to beat faster, which can lead to palpitations or an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation. A rapid heartbeat can lead to heart failure, and atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of blood clots forming and passing to the brain, resulting in stroke. Hyperthyroid-related heart disease may include bulging eyeballs. TCM teaches that chronic, difficult, strange or complicated diseases always have to do with phlegm or blood stagnation, so bleeding points such as Three Weights or 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) is especially helpful for hyperthyroidism due to wind, phlegm or blood stagnation.",

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 2 cun . Needle the healthy side when treating TMJ or deviation of the eyes and mouth. This point can also be bled. | Johnson: Dao Ma: 77.05 First Weight (Chief Point) is needled with Supporting Points 77.06 Second Weight and 77.07 Third Weight in the combination known as 77.05-77.07 Three Weights. These three points are most frequently needled together; however, it should 281 Lower Leg Points be noted that 77.07 Third Weight is similar in location to 77.14 Four Flower Outer/ Textbook ST40 and thus has a stronger influence than First Weight or Second Weight on phlegm. Palpation: When palpating 77.05-77.07 Three Weights, one can feel a pool of energy about the diameter of a pencil eraser. Because these points are easy to feel, I specifically recommend them to students for practicing precise point palpation. With most points in Tung’s system (and these in particular), while I emphasize knowing the exact anatomical location, I always start 0.5 cun above the expected location and then walk my finger downward, palpating for the precise point. In general, it is important to learn how to “feel” acupuncture points. Learn to place your consciousness in the tip of your palpating finger. Do not be discouraged if this takes time, practice and focus. Often the patient will feel when you are on the point, but don’t ask them to tell you where it is, because they might mislead you. Learn to rely on your own palpation by training yourself to feel for the points. Bleeding: Dark veins found in the vicinity of Three Weights are commonly bled to disperse phlegm and blood stagnation. Unilateral vs. bilateral: For one-sided conditions, such as Bell’s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, or pain in a breast, rib, hip, neck or shoulder, needle opposite the affected side. Needle bilaterally to treat systemic diseases and most brain disorders. Direction of stimulation: Almost without exception, when needling these points, we are directing the qi toward the head or the hip, breast, rib or shoulder girdle (including scapula and arm) on the side opposite the pain. For this reason, insert the three needles and then stimulate them distal to proximal (bottom to top). Spleen and liver: For splenomegaly or spleen organ issues, including blood diseases, needle Three Weights on the right side, opposite the spleen. For liver blood diseases, needle either bilaterally or on the left side, opposite the liver organ. Needle sensation: When these needles are inserted, the patient might feel a zing of energy descend down the leg. If the sensation stops at GB40, massage the area extending down the Gallbladder channel and gently tug on the fourth toe or stimulate the needle until the sensation reaches either LV3 or GB41. Do not leave the energy stuck at GB40 or the patient may have difficulty walking when they stand up after the treatment. When Three Weights are needled or even palpated, patients sometimes feel energy movement in their head, as well. Retention: If you are treating the brain, needles should be retained a full hour. Depth: 1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Other names for Three Weights: In the past, the Three Weights points were also called Three Measures or Three Layers. These names are correct and may appear in other written materials. Energetic pathways: The Three Weights points have a profound influence on any disease having to do with wind and phlegm because they are located between the Foot Shao Yang (GB), which dispels wind, and the Foot Yang Ming (ST), which drains dampness. 77.05 First Weight is anterior to GB39, the Meeting Point of Marrow; thus, Three Weights stimulates the production of healthy marrow and blood within the bone. These points are extremely important in influencing the blood, due to the fact that the Liver governs the blood and the Spleen controls the blood, and also due to the internal/external relationships between Liver and Gallbladder, Spleen and Stomach, and the Reaction Areas of Heart, Lung and Spleen. Furthermore, the relationship between the Hand and Foot Shao Yang (SJ/GB) relates to tendons, ligaments, neck, shoulder, arm, wrist and fingers; this also ties into the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yang (SJ) and Foot Shao Yin (KD), influencing bones and brain. Brain: Three Weights treats brain injuries and stroke, in part because the Gallbladder meridian wraps around the head. Widely used with bleeding techniques, these points vitalize the blood by dispersing blood stagnation. They clear the brain and open the orifices by dispersing phlegm and dampness, and they extinguish draft and spasm to restore the brain’s proper motor and sensory functions. Some practitioners report that Three Weights points are more effective for the treatment of functional brain issues than for brain tumors. I have seen good results in the treatment of both functional issues and tumors. Liver organ disease: In cases of serious liver disease, I use 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows with 11.20 Wood Inflammation. However, liver function also improves if I use Three Weights to treat any of the indications listed above. Psychological issues and brain injury: Many psychiatric ailments are actually the result of what Chinese medicine would call “wind and phlegm obstructing the orifices.” This category could include schizophrenia, epilepsy, manic depression, certain types of insomnia and even Alzheimer’s and dementia. Because the Three Weights points have a very powerful ability to circulate blood in the brain, in addition to treating all of the above, they are an excellent choice for the treatment of cerebrovascular events that result in brain damage or deficiencies. Three Weights could be useful in any situation of oxygen depletion to the brain, such as drowning, or brain injury. They should be considered when treating everything from a mild concussion to a severe brain injury, such as frontal lobe impact from a car collision, or for diseases such as encephalitis or hydrocephalus. In these instances, I would consider adding 55.06 Upper Tumor variations. •  Case history (neck arterial occlusion): Because Tung’s system has so many options for treating neck and shoulder pain, and many of them are Gallbladder channel related, I choose to use Three Weights for neck and shoulder issues when there are blood diseases or any symptoms related to the indications for Three Weights. For example, I treated an elderly gentleman with an intravertebral artery that was 100% occluded in his neck. This condition originally caused him to have extreme dizziness and falling incidents. A neurosurgeon said the artery was inoperable because it had become blocked over a period of perhaps 40 years, and if it were surgically cleared, his brain – which had adapted over time to the reduction in blood flow – would be flooded, causing him to die instantly. With treatments including Three Weights, three times weekly for two months, his dizzy spells stopped completely. It is my assumption that this result had to do with the rerouting of the blood supply to his brain. After eighteen months with no episodes, we discontinued treatment with Three Weights to work on his new diagnosis of macular degeneration. Several years later, the macular degeneration is now completely resolved; however, he has begun to experience some dizziness again, as well as signs of dementia. I have begun treatment using 55.02 Flower Bone One to maintain the eyes and Three Weights to clear the brain. Both of these target the head, and so they can be effectively combined, bilaterally. Breast disease: Because ST17 is found on the nipple, and the Gallbladder meridian traverses the side of the breast, opposite-side Three Weights can relieve breast congestion, inflammation and/or tumor. Women who have had surgical procedures often have complications with the lymphatic system, making Three Weights the best choice for treating lymphedema of the arm, due to the wind, phlegm and circulatory influences of these points. Dr. Lee cautioned that for chronic problems such as spleen enlargement and breast cancer, one must be persistent because these conditions cannot be cured easily or quickly. Bleeding dark veins found between the Stomach and Gallbladder channels can be very helpful in reducing swollen and painful breasts.•  Heart and thyroid: Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces too little hormone. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid produces too much hormone. Both can be implicated in heart disease. Hypothyroidism may result in a slow heart rate, a rise in cholesterol, narrowing of the arteries and an increase in fluid surrounding the heart, potentially causing heart failure. Hyperthyroidism causes the heart to beat faster, which can lead to palpitations or an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation. A rapid heartbeat can lead to heart failure, and atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of blood clots forming and passing to the brain, resulting in stroke. Hyperthyroid-related heart disease may include bulging eyeballs. TCM teaches that chronic, difficult, strange or complicated diseases always have to do with phlegm or blood stagnation, so bleeding points such as Three Weights or 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) is especially helpful for hyperthyroidism due to wind, phlegm or blood stagnation.",

I do not use the textbook TCM method to locate this point. Needling Four Flower Upper in the manner described here will almost always elicit a strong qi sensation down the leg, resulting in immediate and outstanding results; therefore, I highly recommend the practitioner carefully and precisely execute the following directions: With one finger on the proximal head of the fibula and another on the base of the tibial tuberosity, draw a horizontal line from the base of the tibial tuberosity that intersects a vertical line drawn directly downward from the head of the fibula. Divide your horizontal line into equal thirds. Four Flower Upper is located one third of the distance lateral from the base of the tibial tuberosity. (77.22 Beside Three Miles is located two thirds of the distance.) •  Accurately verifying the base of the tibial tuberosity will confirm your point location. If you are less than 1.0 cun inferior (on a very tall patient it can be as much as 4 cun) to the head of the fibula, check the base of the tibial tuberosity again, as there is often a further extension that is easily missed. Starting 0.5 cun above and walking your finger downward into this point will help you to identify the exact location and hone your palpation skills, as the power of this point makes it very easy to feel. Note: Please see the drawing above for a good visual depiction of the point location. Four Flower Upper increases stomach acid; do not needle in cases of acid reflux or hot-type stomach ulcer.",

        "techniques": "Needle 2 cun for respiratory conditions, 3 cun for cardiovascular conditions. Needle along the edge of the tibia for maximum effect. This point can also be bled. Bleeding the dark veins in this area can also be effective for chronic history of any of the conditions listed above. | Johnson: Qi sensation: Four Flower Upper (ST36) is easily felt. The patient will know when you are on the point, and you will know, too, because you can palpate a large pool of energy there. Some practitioners describe this energy as a hole. When the point is needled, patients frequently feel a strong qi sensation traveling down their leg, perhaps to the second toe. They describe this sensation in different ways, including electrical, crampy or heavy. Some of my patients feel this sensation as soon as I palpate the point. Sometimes the electrical sensation occurs in both legs, but often it is only on one side, clearing the opposite side, automatically. Ask the patient not to wiggle their legs as you are inserting the needles. If the sensation is intense, I encourage them to wiggle their hands instead. Although the feeling is strong for two or three seconds, within 10 minutes the qi finds its equilibrium and the sensation fades completely. Always provide the patient with a bell or another way to alert you if they need a needle adjusted.•  Varicosities: Often, patients who have varicosities at or beneath ST36, do not want Four Flower Upper (ST36) to be needled, because they remember it as painful. Even when varicosities are not visible, frequently they can be felt beneath the surface as lumpy, squishy, collapsing tissue rather than the smooth feeling of healthy muscle. In such cases, avoiding the varicosities (which is usually recommended) may require treating an entirely different point that is far from ST36. The practitioner has to decide whether to choose a different point altogether or quickly penetrate through the vessel into the deeper tissue underneath, a technique that is only temporarily uncomfortable for the patient. Shallow needling is not recommended in these cases. For one patient I treated, choosing a different point was out of the question. After approximately three months of regular needling of ST36 through this patient’s varicosities, a 3.5” diameter area surrounding the point became firm and smooth in texture, free of varicosities, although they could still be palpated just outside that area. It was remarkable. •  Bleeding: When bleeding, always choose dark vessels in the area rather than the points themselves. I use a three-edged needle, though a 14-gauge hypodermic needle tip can be substituted. In all instances, avoid touching the tibia with the tip of any bleeding needle. If you substitute a hollow hypodermic needle tip for a three-edged needle, you may want to cover the open end with medical tape, both to prevent blood from passing quickly through the needle and to improve your grip. If I am bleeding multiple small veins (between eight and thirty sites) on the lower legs, I may choose a spring-loaded lancet, pushing hard and puncturing three times in quick succession at each site. Where there is a plethora of varicosities, this procedure results in a large volume of black blood, so I always do it with the patient sitting on a shower chair in a bathtub, where cleanup is quick and easy. Allow the body to expel as much blood as it desires. When the bleeding is completely finished, dry the legs thoroughly until all the punctures have clotted. Then, treat the patient with acupuncture, keeping them in your vicinity for at least thirty minutes. Though some people may be concerned about the quantity of blood lost, this black blood was already out of circulation before the bleeding treatment. Relieving the body of its “dirty” blood in this way stimulates the bone marrow to produce fresh, healthy, oxygenated new blood. Make sure you tell your patients to rest, eat well, and go to bed early following a bleeding procedure. Never bleed a patient who has low blood sugar.•  Relax the legs: Before needling Four Flower Upper and Four Flower Middle, rock your patient’s legs gently from side to side to ensure the muscles are completely relaxed, because the deep needling done on these points will prevent them from relaxing the muscles once the needles are inserted. Notice the position of their feet; patients who hold their big toes together are subconsciously engaging their thigh muscles. Do not try to separate their feet, but bring their attention to this simply by asking them to allow their knees to fall outward. •  Same side or opposite side: Four Flower points may be needled on the same side or opposite side to treat pain of the shoulders, arms, elbows and index finger. Stomach meridian points are the only points that are equally effective when needled on the same or opposite side of the pathology. •  Needle depth and retention: Deep insertion is common with this point; it often requires a 60mm needle. If the patient is less than 5’ tall, a 40mm needle insertion is adequate. Patients taller than 6’ require a 60mm needle for issues affecting their head. While deep insertion is initially sedating, when the needle is retained for a long time, it tonifies the point. When needling the bottom to treat the top (legs to head), use a deeper needle and retain it for a longer period of time, up to one hour, even when the effects are immediately noticed. •  Depths: Four Flower Upper is a good point to contrast deep and shallow needling techniques, as a deep needle is required in order for the qi to reach the head. Insertion of 0.5-1.0 cun gently tonifies or addresses adjacent conditions, such as knee or toe pain. Insertion of 1.0-2.0 cun can reach the abdomen. Insertion of 2.0-2.5 cun will effectively treat heart disease and angina. Inserting a 60mm needle is the most effective for glaucoma and frontal headache. Face and head disorders: 2.5-3.0 cun •  Heart disease and asthma: 2.0-2.5 cun •  Gastrointestinal disease: 1.0-2.0 cun•  Leg disease: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "T36 was one of Dr. Lee’s favorite points. She would say, “When you don’t know what to do, needle ST36.” (Note: Dr. Young feels the same way about GB31.)•  Energetic pathways: As the most powerful tonification and He-Sea point of the entire body, Four Flower Upper (ST36) regulates and adjusts the qi and blood of all the channels, strengthening the Spleen and Stomach to treat a wide variety of chronic illnesses. Because Four Flower Upper is needled alongside the tibia (one finger’s breadth lateral to the anterior tibial crest), the point has a bone-treating-bone Kidney tonification function, whether treating Spleen and Kidney yang deficiency or Liver and Kidney yin deficiency. Four Flower Upper goes to the Kidney level, treating chronic problems as well as those involving the Luo channels. It is very good for any problem on the front of the body, head, chest and/or abdomen. Four Flower Upper has the Reaction Areas of Heart and Lung. As the earth point on an earth meridian, following the mother/child producing cycle, Four Flower Upper tonifies earth to generate metal and is thus very effective for treating many conditions such as asthma and Crohn’s disease. Due to the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (Stomach) and Hand Jue Yin (Pericardium), Four Flower Upper is extraordinarily effective for coronary heart disease. In this case, earth can be used to sedate fire. Because the Yang Ming channel has more qi and more blood, we use this point to safely sedate excess, in conditions such as frontal headache, chest pain, frozen shoulder or toothache. For these treatments, deep needling (50-60mm) is required. Occasionally, bleeding may be the treatment of choice. •  Bleeding: Bleeding is very useful in the treatment of any hot or excess condition, such as: coronary heart disease, asthma, problems of the head, chest or abdomen, acute or chronic gastroenteritis, gout, skin issues, or any problems on the frontal body (Stomach channel). Because the Yang Ming (ST) channel has more qi and more blood, ST36 and points found along the Four Flower line (Stomach channel) can be safely and frequently bled without depleting the patient.•  Knee pain (Guiding Point): 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3) or 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2) can be used as a Guiding Point for knee pain. There are three primary reasons for this: first, the knee is tightly bound by tendons and ligaments (governed by wood); second, it is nourished by a plethora of blood vessels (relating to Heart, Pericardium and Liver; the Liver stores the blood); third, through the Hand and Foot Jue Yin relationship (PC/LV), we then connect the Pericardium to the Stomach meridian transiting the knee via the special relationship between the Hand Jue Yin (PC) and Foot Yang Ming (ST). Additionally, Master Tung taught that knee pain comes from the Heart, so all Tung’s points whose names include “Heart” or “Fire” can also be used to treat the knee.•  Asthma: In Tung’s acupuncture we have many options for treating asthma related to various origins, such as the Heart, Lung, Liver, Spleen or Kidney. The Kidney is the root of the whole body’s energy and houses the ancestral/pre-natal qi, so when asthma is the Kidney-deficient type, we want to determine whether it is yin deficiency or yang deficiency. When phlegm accumulates in the lungs, often Spleen qi is also deficient. Because the Spleen and Stomach are responsible for post-natal qi, digestion, metabolism and immune function, I often combine earth and water (Spleen and Kidney) treatment in deficient-type asthma. Usually I make this assessment using pulse and tongue diagnosis. If the pulse is weak and the tongue is pale with teeth marks, the asthma is likely to be the type caused by Kidney yang deficiency and Spleen qi deficiency. In this case, I use Four Flower Upper (ST36) with SP6 San Yin Jiao and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/Water Through. Moxa heat packs on UB23 Shen Shu, DU4 Ming Men and REN4 Guan Yuan are also useful. If the asthma is the Kidney-yin-deficient type, the pulse is deep and rapid and the tongue is light red and dry. In this case, I use 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors (Shen Guan – Tung’s Master Kidney point, and Man Emperor – Tung’s SP6, both found on the Spleen channel) with 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/Water Through.•  Heart disease: Four Flower Upper is extraordinarily effective for coronary heart disease in two ways. In one case, earth (child) can be used to sedate fire (mother), draining heart excess. Signs of heart excess can include a red face, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), chest pain and high blood pressure. However, tachycardia is due to oxygen deficiency, so another way to think about the treatment of heart disease with ST36 is to recognize that the Four Flower Line (earth) has a regulating effect on earth, tonifying the mother (fire) to generate the son (metal). For these reasons, the Four Flower line is used for heart and lung, stomach and intestines. Most heart conditions are chronic in nature, and chronic diseases always involve phlegm and blood stagnation, so we might also bleed 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) to disperse phlegm. An alternative to treating Four Flower Upper (ST36) in the treatment of heart conditions is to use 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points, located on the midline of the thigh. The Heart Passing Points are not only good for coronary heart disease but also are my points of choice when heart disease causes circulatory obstruction in the legs and feet (black feet). Don’t forget 11.05 Zhong Jian (index finger Hernia Point), which is easy to needle quickly to treat chest pain or arrhythmia. In cases of heart deficiency – signs of which include cold hands and feet, pale face, and a thready irregular pulse – we instead utilize 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master (LV2/LV3), because in this circumstance wood (mother) is used to tonify fire (child), thus strengthening the heart. •  ST36 with PC6: There is an ancient point prescription that combines ST36 with PC6 Nei Guan. It is called Old Doctors’ Two Old Needles. Based on my assessment of the patient’s condition I will choose the proper needle length to insert into ST36 (for heart disease, use a deeper needle, for general use 30-40mm length needles are adequate). Because PC6 is also used to open the chest, Old Doctors’ Two Old Needles works like a charm in cases of real chest pain. Interestingly, Master Tung’s acupuncture recognizes the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC); perhaps Tung’s ancestors were the “Old Doctors.” •  Case history (angina): A deep (50-60mm) needle applied bilaterally on Four Flower Upper (ST36) will eliminate severe chest pain in less than one minute. I have seen this happen countless times and have learned to keep long needles in the glove box of my car for just such situations. In most cases, I also apply 77.09 Four Flower Middle bilaterally. Before I can even insert all four needles, the chest pain is gone. The needles must be retained for forty-five minutes to one hour so that circulation to the heart is adequately restored. One time I took my elderly neighbor to visit his slightly younger brother in a convalescent facility. As we were leaving the facility, my friend began to experience chest pain. It was not crushing and he could still speak, so I did not hesitate and ran to my glove box to retrieve my 60mm needles. This was one of many situations in which the chest pain was entirely gone before I could needle all four points. This same patient had been prescribed Procardia for the problem, but he refused to take it. Using Hua Tou Zai Zao Wan and Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle on a regular basis, he never experienced chest pain again. These points are phenomenal for increasing circulation to the heart and lungs. •  Heart numbness: Four Flower Middle treats heart numbness characterized by inability to sit still or lie down comfortably, and frequent changing of position. •  “How can one know if the arteries of the heart have hardened? In Chinese medicine we think that if the patient has pain on both sides of their heart, their coronary arteries have become sclerotic. How can one know if their heart has become paralyzed or numb? If one has a slow pulse and they toss and turn and cannot rest peacefully in bed, this is called heart organ paralysis or heart numbness. In this case, the patient will feel miserable, have a heavy heart, and have difficulty breathing” (Dr. Lee, 1992).•  “If one goes to bleed for heart paralysis or numbness but cannot find any visible blood vessels on the Four Flower Line then tonify 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master instead” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Frontal headaches: I can immediately get rid of virtually any headache (except in cases of brain tumor). When needling for any type of headache, it is best to avoid using local acupuncture points as they may exacerbate the problem. Often I start by cupping the neck; however, this is not necessary if the patient is not complaining about neck tension. For chronic migraines, bleeding the vein just above the outside edge of the eyebrow is always the best and most effective treatment. A frontal headache is usually digestive or sinus related. It also can be caused by excessive Liver fire fueling Heart fire, in which case the headache is more severe and may have associated nausea. Blood stagnation may result in early morning excess headaches, as the pressure builds when the body is still. •  Diagnosis: First, we need to decide whether the frontal headache is an excess or deficient type. This is easily determined by asking the patient to place their fingers on their eyeballs and apply light pressure. This should be done with warm hands, because if the hands are cold, the cool pressure may feel good to a patient with an excess headache. If the headache is excess, they will not like warm pressure against their eyeballs. If the headache is deficient, they won’t mind the pressure, and it may even provide some relief.•  For excess-type headache: Bilaterally bleed or deeply needle 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle (50-60mm needles).•  For deficient-type headache: Bilaterally needle 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) and 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4). Because deficient frontal headaches may be caused by blood deficiency or fatigue, we might also consider implementing Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment (bilaterally needle ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, and LU7 in this order, tonifying the bottom and sedating the top). See 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) for additional information related to deficient-type frontal headaches.•  For brain tumor: Bilaterally needle 55.06 Upper Tumor; unilaterally needle: 66.10 Fire Connection (SP3), 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) and 66.12 Fire Scatter (KD2). (Some practitioners needle these bilaterally, though Master Tung advised not to.) See also 77.05- 77.07 Three Weights (Tung’s GB39).•  Case history (excess frontal headache): I arrived at the house of a friend who had invited a group over for Thanksgiving dinner. One of the guests had retired to a back bedroom some hours before, with a severe and disabling frontal headache. When I entered the room she was lying in the dark, unable to communicate well. All of the other guests were very concerned. I went to my car and retrieved he 60mm needles that I keep in the glove box for emergencies. I needled Four Flower Upper and Four Flower Middle bilaterally, and before I inserted the fourth needle her headache was virtually gone. She stayed in the dark for another hour, with the needles in place. After the needles were removed, she rejoined the party with a good appetite and no headache. This outcome is my common expectation for Four Flower Upper and Four Flower Middle. Though the symptoms may be relieved immediately upon the insertion of needles, the headache will return if the needles are not retained long enough.•  Case history (Crohn’s disease with glaucoma): I treated a 65-year-old man who had glaucoma and Crohn’s disease. He had had multiple laser surgeries on both eyes, and a large portion of his intestine had been removed. Once each week, I treated him with 55.02 Flower Bone One and then had him turn onto his back to needle Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle bilaterally, because these points are used for pressure behind the eyes as well as gastroenteritis. With additional support from an herbal formula, his Crohn’s disease was completely healed within six months. His intraocular pressure started to descend nicely, from 22 mmHg to 12 mmHg. His visual field exams also improved radically, and he was able to entirely discontinue his glaucoma medication within two years of treatment. •  Frozen shoulder (with same-side ST36): Frozen shoulder – also known as “fifty-year shoulder” – refers to a rigid condition of the shoulder joint that frequently occurs following an injury, but it also may have a slow onset. When a patient reports chronic or recurring shoulder pain, there is the potential for it to evolve into a completely immobilized state. In all of Tung’s acupuncture, structural problems are treated using points on the opposite side of the pathology, with the exception of the Stomach channel points. Because Stomach channel points are equally effective when needled on the same side as on the opposite side, when treating frozen shoulder I needle Four Flower Upper/Middle on the affected side to treat the Yang Ming aspect. If there are dark veins in the vicinity of the Stomach and Gallbladder channels, they may also be bled (on the same side as the frozen shoulder). Cup first, then bleed, then needle.•  Cupping: Cup outward from the spine, all the way around the entire shoulder girdle, to the front. Cup from the top of the neck, down to UB17, and all the way over to DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, located over the outside edge of the scapula. Cup the deltoid and in front of the shoulder (LU1-LU2 area) with lighter pressure. The skin will be black after cupping! Sometimes shoulders may feel worse after cupping (the only joint where this seems to happen). If the patient can raise the affected arm, shave and cup the armpit. Frozen shoulder involves stagnation and poor circulation. If you don’t pull out the toxins, the qi cannot move into the area to heal it. Cup over several treatments, until the skin stops coloring (usually at least three cupping sessions). Each time the patient is cupped, their range of motion is likely to increase, so make sure they maintain the improvement by exercising the area.Exercise: Though the patient will complain and resist, it is essential that they routinely do the exercise of walking their fingers up a wall, with the goal of bringing the armpit to the wall or as close as possible. The more frozen the shoulder joint is, the more painful and difficult this exercise will be. For every other type of joint pain, I suggest that the patient rest and pamper the affected area. However, with frozen shoulder, resting only results in further and prolonged paralysis. As much as a patient may complain, wall walking can free the joint and hasten the healing. They may require herbs, NSAIDs or narcotics in order to manage this exercise, yet it is crucial.•  Bleeding LU5 is probably the single most important element of treating a frozen shoulder. LU5 is the water point on a metal channel; sedate LU5 so metal will not overcome wood. Because tendons and ligaments are governed by the wood element, once the wood relaxes, the arm can be raised. When we needle directly adjacent to the tendon, we bring in the tendon-treating-tendon influence, which is especially good for muscle and tendon spasms. In this case, it treats the shoulder, but it affects any spasm, including spasm from menstrual cramping. Bleeding is done on the affected side, but if you are not accustomed to bleeding, sedate LU5 on the opposite side.•  Opposite-side points: Recognizing that a frozen shoulder usually involves all of the channels, I often use far more needles to treat this condition than any other. Needle opposite-side 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan), 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), 44.06 Shoulder Center (add extra needles to form Shoulder Triangle); needle same-side 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle (or Zhong Ping, found 1.0 cun inferior to ST36 [Dr. Young]). Same-side Guiding Points could be chosen from: SI3 Hou Xi, A.04 San Cha Three, or 22.06 Middle White (Zhong Bai). For serious pain, I may also needle opposite-side 11.16 Fire Knee or left-side 1010.22 Nose Wing. All of the above point combinations can be used simultaneously when treating frozen shoulder; however, if the restriction is primarily on one or two channels, then choose from the following Chief and Guiding Points:•  77.18 Shen Guan and shoulder pain: When the patient cannot raise their arm, we use the Hand and Foot Tai Yin relationship (LU/SP) to reach the front of the shoulder, which relates to the Lung and Large Intestine. For anterior shoulder pain, needle opposite-side Kidney Gate (Shen Guan – Master Tung’s “Master Kidney Point,” located on the Spleen channel) with 22.04 Da Bai on the same side as a Guiding Point. Shen Guan is used in many shoulder point prescriptions because it has a unique relationship to both the front and the back of the shoulder. Through the special relationship between the Hand Tai Yang and Foot Tai Yin (SI/SP), we reach the back of the shoulder (SI9-SI10 area), and we use SI3 Hou Xi as a Guiding Point. Additionally, Shen Guan has the Reaction Area of the Kidney, and thus it utilizes the special relationship between the Leg Shao Yin (KD) and the Hand Shao Yang (SJ); both of these relate to bone and the San Jiao channel on the back of the shoulder. For this reason, we might consider using 22.06 Middle White (Tung’s SJ3) as a Guiding Point, as well. Three Guiding Points is too many; choose one or two at most.•  77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold: When the shoulder cannot move forward or back, and the arm cannot be brought behind the back, needle opposite-side Leg Five/One Thousand Gold with same-side A.04 San Cha Three or 22.06 Middle White (Tung’s SJ3) as a Guiding Point.44.06 Shoulder Triangle: Needling Shoulder Triangle is my favorite way to address pain in the opposite deltoid. When the shoulder pain is primarily muscular, I am always sure to cup the deltoid. Deltoid pain is a common symptom of overuse; however, it can also indicate severe cervical stenosis and may be the first obvious sign. For this reason, when patients complain of deltoid pain, I always make a thorough assessment of the cervical spine.•  Surgical intervention: Some patients opt for surgery because a frozen shoulder joint can be broken free under anesthesia, restoring range of motion. Patients choose this option to have better use of their arm, even when they are warned that their pain level will be the same after surgery. When a patient seeks acupuncture after this surgery, my treatment is identical to the treatment for a patient whose shoulder is still frozen. I always start with cupping and bleeding.•  Frequency of treatment: Frozen shoulders require patience and diligence from both patient and practitioner. Keep the cost low so that the patient can be treated as often as possible. Use anti-inflammatory agents such as emulsified turmeric and omega-3 fatty acids. Strong treatment is required.•  Gout (Dr. Young): Excess heat in the Yang Ming (ST) channel can cause gout. The treatment principle is to strengthen the Spleen to eliminate damp. Gout usually occurs in older men due to high stress and excess consumption of meat and alcohol. The following foods need to be avoided: mushrooms, shrimp, peanuts, internal organs, asparagus, beets, oranges, strawberries, sour fruits, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Foods that treat gout include: cherry juice, watermelon juice and celery seeds.•  Treatment: For gout in the big toe or middle toe, needle opposite-side 11.27.3 Five Tiger Three; sedate same-side 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36). Every ten minutes, raise the Four Flower Upper needle by half of its insertion depth, until you pull it out.•  Alternate treatment: Needle opposite-side 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31); tonify opposite-side 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) or sedate same-side 77.08 (deep needling with strong stimulation; after ten minutes, raise the needle by half of its insertion depth and stimulate again; after ten more minutes, stimulate once more and pull the needle out quickly, to remove heat from the blood (“Cold Heaven Method”).•  77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) reduces acid and is especially good for patients who are taking diuretics and have severe gout.•  Dr. Lee formula: When I was twenty-five years old, I experienced the most excruciating gout. Gout usually occurs in men who are eating too much meat and drinking too much alcohol. I had been vegetarian for seven years and never drank alcohol; however, at that time I had a practice treating HIV patients and was extremely stressed out. Even hopping on my healthy foot caused a sensation in my affected ankle that could only be described as “broken glass.” Though I don’t know its name or where she found it, Miriam gave me the following formula, which worked like a charm. This formula is cold in nature, and you will need to tonify the patient after they take it. For weak, older patients, use it only in the spring and summer, as it may be too depleting otherwise. It will decrease uric acid. If the patient uses this formula for ten days, they probably will never have gout again. The only patients in my practice who have ever had a recurrence were two men who could not give up drinking red wine. •  Gout formula: 3 Zhi Mu, 4 Ban Lang Gen, 4 Tu Fu Ling, 2 Zhi Zi, 3 Cang Zhu, 3 Bai Zhu, 3 Chi Shao Yao, 3 Bai Shao, 3.5 Niu Xi, .8 Cao Guo Ren, 3 Jin Yin Hua, 3 Ju Hua, 5 Lian Qiao, 2 Gan Cao, 3.5 Jing Jie, 4 Bai Xing Ren, 3 Yi Yi Ren, 3.5 San Leng.32 •  Note: Grind to a powder; take one tablespoon twice daily with warm water. Or, if the formula is encapsulated; take ten “00” capsules three times a day. •  Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment (ML10): When I studied with Dr. Lee, I watched her use her Ten Great Needles Treatment between ten and twenty times every day for a very wide variety of ailments. It was her primary “go-to” treatment for all colds, flus and allergies (with LI20 Welcome Fragrance), and for qi- and blood-deficient conditions such as: exhaustion and fatigue, postpartum anemia, post-surgical weakness, recovery from chemotherapy and radiation, severe blood loss, deficiency-type epilepsy, hypotension, hypothyroid, weakness causing mental instability, depression, confusion or anxiety. This treatment is excellent to address grief after the loss of a loved one, as it releases metal and bolsters the earth beneath the patient’s feet. Miriam often needled ML10 to address blood-deficient-type insomnia, adding Yin Tang (Extra Point) and DU20 Bai Hui, a combination also used with auricular points to increase metabolism in treatments for weight loss. Note: ML10 is not used for treating excess-type high blood pressure or other Liver-excess-type conditions.•  History: Dr. Lee’s O.M.D. thesis was published as Insights of a Senior Acupuncturist (1992). In this work, she explained the origin of her Ten Great Needles Treatment, which she created to address the widespread depression and mental health disorders she began to see in America. These types of disorders were less common in China, where the struggle for life itself took so much energy that few people were able to suffer anguish over the quality of their life. Consulting the Nei Jing, Dr. Lee found the following passage: “When the Stomach and Spleen, the central jiao, are attacked by emotion, pure qi cannot ascend to the brain, and the evil qi, the waste, cannot descend. It will remain stuck in the Stomach.” She rationalized that in Western terms, pure qi equates to oxygen, and evil qi equates to carbon dioxide, and when the pure qi, or oxygen, is not ascending to the head and the evil qi is not dispelled, mental disorders ensue, and the patient is not able to find their way forward in life. She needled these points and asked the patient to doze for half an hour, if possible. When returning to the patient, we knew when the pure qi had arrived because the color of the patient’s face had changed; their cheeks were pink and their face had shen.•  Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment: ST36, SP6 San Yin Jiao, LI11 Qu Chi, LI4 He Gu and LU7 Lie Que. In cases of deficiency or weakness, the points on the legs are tonified first, to raise the pure qi; then, the points on the arms are sedated to remove the evil qi and to make room for the pure qi to arrive. If the patient has excessive stagnation in the upper body, we may want to disperse the upper points before tonifying the lower points, to avoid causing a blockage in the center and pushing against the excess. ST36 frees up stuck qi in the middle jiao, causes the pure qi to ascend, adjusts the qi and blood of all the channels, strengthens the Spleen and Stomach, calms the spirit, and strengthens the Kidney, vision and hearing. ST36 has a regulatory function that can address blood pressure, help to increase or decrease white blood cells, and increase stomach acid, making it an effective remedy for food stagnation. I usually use a 30mm needle on this point for a constitutional type of treatment; however, if a patient has Heart excess, use a deep needle on ST36 (50mm). •  SP6 San Yin Jiao (77.21 Man Emperor) is chosen because stagnant Liver qi can cause depression, and SP6 links the Liver with the Kidney and Spleen. SP6 controls yin blood, regulates the reproductive system, and strengthens the Kidney qi to restore memory and vitality while bringing equilibrium to the Three Leg Yin.•  LI11 Qu Chi and LI4 He Gu help to move the bowels, eliminating waste and helping the evil qi to descend and drain. Additionally, LI11 dispels wind and relieves the surface, regulates qi and increases white blood cells. LI4 opens the Lung and Large Intestine and treats many diseases from the neck up. This point has a close relationship to the San Jiao, which regulates qi through all the jiao, regulates the pores, and expels wind. This point causes energy to rise and scatter.•  LU7 Lie Que clears the Kidney (which rules the brain), treats the head and neck, clears the chest, and treats the intestines. Because Lung is the mother of Kidney, we can use the analogy of a straw in a glass of water to describe the ability of the Lung to draw qi upwards, strengthening the Kidney. If we cap the top of a straw with our finger and lift it out of the water, the straw remains full. This illustrates the action of strong Lung qi. When we uncap the straw, the water drops out; this can be likened to Lung deficiency causing Kidney weakness (incontinence). If the Lung energy is weak, there may be anal prolapse, menstrual spotting or urinary incontinence. If Lung qi is excess, fluids are retained, causing difficult urination in conditions such as prostate enlargement. This is why an excess-type cough can delay labor and delivery. In order to induce labor, we must sedate the Lungs.ML10 variations:•  Shen Guan: For patients who are elderly or extremely qi deficient, 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan) can be added to the ML10 protocol. Please note that I sometimes define “elderly” as 40 years or older, as this is the age when the qi begins to wane. Shen Guan is frequently added when conditions are chronic, or for elderly patients.•  ML10 during pregnancy: During pregnancy, it is important to treat less frequently, using fewer needles and lighter stimulation. Miriam created the following variation on her Ten Great Needles Treatment specifically for pregnancy. Bilaterally needle: Four Flower Upper (ST36), 77.18 Shen Guan, LI11 Qu Chi, LU7 Lie Que (30 mm needles with only light stimulation). •  Caution: While treating pregnant patients, do not forget that both LI4 He Gu and SP6 San Yin Jiao are forbidden to needle during pregnancy!•  ST36 increases stomach acid: Needling Four Flower Upper tonifies Kidney yang, increasing stomach acid. (Note: SP9 Yin Lin Quan and 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) decrease stomach acid.) It is best not to needle Four Flower Upper if stomach acid is a problem; however, the point may be bled with good effects, treating chronic gastroenteritis, gastric pain and ulcers. •  ST36 promotes urination: Because Four Flower Upper promotes urination, I always ask the patient to empty their bladder before I needle this point. •  Toothache: Four Flower Upper treats toothache by sedating Stomach heat and Heart fire, pulling the qi downward.•  Case history (colitis): A twenty-year-old female patient had four years of chronic colitis (diarrhea five times a day). LI11 Qu Chi and Four Flower Upper were needled, and Li Zhong Wan and Shen Ling Bai Zhu San were prescribed. She returned ten days later and reported only one bout of diarrhea. •  Epilepsy and ST36:•  Case history (excess-type epilepsy): I treated a 38-year-old landscaper who was in peak physical condition. He was experiencing grand mal seizures that occurred most frequently in the early morning hours, and occasionally during the day (these would be considered Liver excess type). The seizures that woke him up between the hours of 1:00–4:00 a.m. caused him to severely chew his tongue and sometimes even break his teeth (a good reminder not to put your fingers into the mouth of a person having a seizure). Often after one of these severe seizures, he would experience double vision for several days. I found that a 60mm needle, inserted into 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle, would correct his vision. It is important to differentiate between an excess-type seizure and a deficient-type seizure. An easy indication can be the time of day when the seizure typically occurs. When a physically strong epileptic patient is lying still through the night, excess energy is not released through activity, resulting in more frequent nighttime or early morning seizures. Patients with epilepsy hate having seizures in public, primarily because frightened bystanders usually call 911, and the poor epileptic then wakes up in the emergency room, still having difficulty communicating. This patient knew that he had one to two seconds to throw himself into the nearest bushes to avoid this predictable outcome. He would wake up several hours later and attempt to go either to my clinic or to his home. I am not making any particular recommendation to those who witness someone having a seizure, but simply reporting their experience as it has been related to me. This type of case is a perfect candidate for a ketogenic diet or CBD oil (18:1) as both are anti-inflammatory. I recently gave this high potency CBD oil to my nephew who was having regular epileptic seizures, it has now been six weeks since his last seizure. My first patient using this CBD oil is an injured racing dog. He was having two seizures per week, severe tendon pain in one leg and an untreatable toe infection on the opposite foot, causing him to whimper a lot, especially at night. He has had no seizures since he began the CBD oil three months ago, and no longer whimpers. He is scheduled for an amputation of the toe, we will see if that is still required. I cannot believe how effective CBD is, and am now prescribing it for many of my more difficult cases, with tremendous results. One seventy-year old woman’s C-reactive protein has dropped from 19.6 to 12.2 in four weeks.•  Case history (deficient-type epilepsy): People who typically have seizures in the late afternoon, and not as often between midnight and 7:00 a.m, are more likely to be having deficient-type seizures. Four Flower Upper can be used to treat both excess and deficient types of epilepsy, but the way in which the point is used and the point combinations are very different, as are the herbs that treat the conditions. Remember that a deep needle on ST36 sedates excesses in the head. However, using a 30mm needle on ST36, as a part of Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment, will tonify and strengthen qi and blood while also expelling wind from the upper part of the body. The efficacy of this was beautifully illustrated when I treated a 35-year-old woman who was afraid to leave her house for fear of having a seizure and winding up in the emergency room again. Because her presentation was deficient – fatigue, cold hands and feet, pale tongue, soft stools, and brain fog – I chose to use Dr. Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment and give the formula Wu Chi Bai Feng Wan to strengthen and build the patient’s constitution. Her first few treatments required me to provide house calls, but by her fourth treatment she was confident enough to take the bus to my clinic. I treated her for approximately six months, after which she was happily released. •  Case history (asthma, Dr. Lee): “A five-year-old girl had spent the night in the hospital with an acute asthma attack. The entire night she had struggled for breath, crying, and vomiting. Her parents knew I start work at 5:30 am and so checked their daughter out of the hospital and brought her to me. They immediately put her on a treatment table and then went out into the waiting room to sleep. The little girl was crying. She was well-built physically. I used a 2.5 cun needle and inserted this deeply at Four Flower Upper. All at once, the child vomited a large lump of heavy, sticky phlegm, like a stone, that had been stuck in her stomach. Two years later, I met the child and her mother again. The mother told me that since that day, the child had not suffered any further asthma attacks. The child had grown considerably since then and had a very good complexion” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (mental confusion, Dr. Lee): “Another time, I was asked to treat a young man who was a freshman in college. His family was very concerned since he did not seem able to remember things. Mental cases in which concentration and memory are impaired are often due to phlegm obstructing the portals of the Heart. In such cases, one must needle Four Flower Upper or Four Flower Middle very deeply, at least 2.5 cun. I also needle in such cases SP6 San Yin Jiao, LI11 Qu Chi, LI4 He Gu and LU7 Lie Que (ML10). The lower points are supplemented and the upper points drained. By draining the Large Intestine phlegm is discharged with the feces. In any case, I treated this young man three times, and after that his grades improved dramatically. The next year he took a heavier course load. I asked him if this worried him and he answered, ‘piece of cake’” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Case history (dry mouth, Dr. Lee): “Once a woman more than 80 years old came to me with dryness of the mouth. She could not eat bread or toast. She had to chew and chew these, and still they would only form a ball in her mouth, which she could not swallow. She said that it felt like chewing a sweater, as it was so dry and tasteless. I bled Four Flower Upper and immediately one could see more moisture in her mouth. That night she was able to eat and she returned the next day asking to be bled again. I explained that since the mouth was still moist we should wait one week before repeating the treatment.

        "techniques": "Needle 1.5 - 2 cun for asthma and eye problems, 3 cun for heart disease. Needling close to or along the tibia can yield the best therapeutic effect. Bilateral needling is recommended for treating lung disorders, pain of the elbow, scapula, and fingers. This point can also be bled, especially when treating gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disorders, chest stuffiness and pleurisy. Veins around this point can be bled with a three-edged needle to treat arteriosclerosis, acute stomach pain, enteritis, and chest congestion. | Johnson: See 77.08 Four Flower Upper, Needling Notes, as this point shares similar techniques. Dao Ma: Four Flower Middle is mostly needled as a Dao Ma with 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36). In many Tung’s acupuncture books, Four Flower Middle has indications in addition to those listed for Four Flower Upper; most of them are bone related. Though Four Flower Upper (ST36) may be needled alone, Four Flower Middle is usually used alongside it. Both points are considered Chief Points – they are equal in strength and power. Depths: 0.5-1.0 cun insertion gently tonifies or addresses adjacent conditions, such as knee or toe pain. 1.0-2.0 cun insertion reaches the abdomen. 2.0-2.5 cun insertion effectively treats heart disease and angina. Inserting a 60mm needle is the most effective for glaucoma and frontal headache.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Four Flower Middle shares the energetic pathways of 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36). See 77.08 Four Flower Upper for additional comments/combinations common to these two powerful points. Bone inflammation and bone spurs: Four Flower Middle, when needled or bled with 77.10 Four Flower Quasi, treats bone inflammation, deformity or swelling of the bones (also known as “steaming bones”), especially of the hands, and bone spurs of the knee and heel. Together, these points address inflammation of the bone using earth (Stomach) to control water (Kidney). Alternatively, 77.11 Four Flower Lower combined with 77.12 Bowel Intestine are also used for bone spurs of the knee and heel (also known as “cutting bone,” according to Dr. Young). All of the points described above must be needled close to the bone to activate the bone-treating-bone system. However, when bleeding, never touch the bone with the tip of a bleeding needle; instead bleed the veins nearby. Patients usually notice a reduction in their symptoms after approximately two weeks of treatment. See 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One for additional information, including nutritional advice, related to the treatment of bone spurs. Weight loss (Dr. Young): Needling or bleeding the Four Flower points releases toxins. I realized these points also promoted weight loss when many patients lost weight after bone spur treatments. Bone spur pain is usually worse in heavier patients, especially when they walk down stairs. Excess frontal headache (Dr. Lee): “I use Four Flower Middle quite frequently for the treatment of headaches, including migraines in both men and women, no matter how long they have suffered. However, for this one must use a long needle, at least 2.5 cun. If one presses the patient’s eyeballs and they feel hard like marbles, this means that they are prone to headaches. It also means that the blood vessels behind the eyes have become hard. The eyeballs are related to the Liver and the Liver is very susceptible to overwork and emotional stress. These headaches are due to Liver fire inflaming Heart fire. This point is on the Stomach channel. The Stomach is the child of the Heart. If one drains the child, it will automatically drain the mother. After the first 2-3 treatments, the patient may not notice much difference. However, after 4-5 treatments, their headaches will be greatly reduced and will become infrequent. Sometimes I use this point with LV3 Tai Chong. When this point is used for asthma, it drains the Stomach so that the Stomach will no longer over-control the Kidneys. Then the Kidneys may grasp the qi sent down by the Lungs” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

This area of the lower calf is heavily wrapped in ligaments that stabilize the fibula, a floating bone without any joint of its own. Because of these ligaments, insertion can be very difficult at both of these points. Four Flower Lower is needled between the tibia and the fibula, at the lowest part of the calf, where it is possible to insert the needle between the bones.

Four Flower Lower is needled between the tibia and the fibula, at the lowest part of the calf, where it is possible to insert the needle between the bones.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Four Flower Outer regulates qi and blood due to its proximity to ST40 Feng Long, the Gathering Point of phlegm and the Luo Point of the Stomach channel. Because the Yang Ming channel has more qi and more blood, it is the most commonly used channel for bloodletting. Bleeding Four Flower Outer clears blood heat, disperses blood stagnation, and dissolves phlegm. TCM teaches that difficult, chronic, strange or complicated diseases have to do with phlegm or blood stagnation. For example, phlegm obstructing the brain leads to stroke, but phlegm can also obstruct elsewhere. 77.07 Third Weight and Four Flower Outer can be used interchangeably as they are located very close to each other and share the similar energetics of dispersing wind and phlegm. Cholesterol in the blood: In TCM, high cholesterol is considered a type of phlegm and can be seen as oil in the blood. Oil and water do not mix, so when the cholesterol is high, there are jagged edges in the appearance of the blood. Rather than flowing in a smooth stream, it looks “choppy.” Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia: Hypertension is a wind and phlegm condition that can be caused by high cholesterol or arteriosclerosis. 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40) and Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) are used together to disperse phlegm and open the blood vessels. Four Flower Outer lowers cholesterol because it is the Stomach Luo point for phlegm; TCM considers cholesterol as a type of phlegm. Stiff neck and high cholesterol are often related.

If veins are visible, bleed them instead of the points. Midline bleeding: If you are bleeding on the midline, it is necessary to puncture firmly, as most patients’ skin is tough in this area. The patient should lie on their back with their legs bent, knees together and feet spread apart (like a tripod). When the legs are positioned this way, a space will open between the patella and the top of the tibia. Have the patient cough each time you pierce the skin (twice on each knee). Bleed all four points quickly in sequence so that the patient is not left anticipating the treatment 315 Lower Leg Points on the opposite side. You may need to pinch the skin firmly at each point to get blood from these points, swiping one drop at a time. Ten to twenty drops per point should be effective; however, I continue bleeding up to 50 drops per point if it is bleeding easily. If you find a vein crossing this space beneath the patella, always use the vessel, Point Location and Needling Technique. Lateral bleeding: Since my early days observing in Dr. Lee’s clinic and studying with Dr. Young, and until recently in my own practice, I always bled these points on the midline just below the tip of the patella and approximately 0.5 cun distal, never realizing that the official location was on a lateral line. One time, I bled Two Lips in this midline location on a 50-year-old woman, and though there was never any infection, a small red dot remained at each point of insertion for months following the treatment, and she developed minor knee pain. Since that time I have occasionally chosen to bleed Two Lips at the lateral location, avoiding the patellar ligament, though I have found this to be less effective. If the patient is younger and the herpes is aggressive, I still use the midline location, as I did for more than 25 years without incident.",
        "comments": "Dr. Lee pioneered the selection of these points for treating herpes: “Because the names of these last two points translate as Upper and Lower Lips, and because in Chinese the labia of the vagina are called the large and small lips, I got the idea that maybe these two points might be able to treat herpes genitalia. When a doctor’s wife came in to see me with very inflamed labia due to severe herpes, I decided to try this idea. I bled the four points on both legs and black blood ran copiously out. That night, four hours later, the woman called me to say that the pain, itching, and inflammation had ceased. I told this woman to ask her husband to come in so I could treat him so that he would not simply re-infect her. He came in the next day. Of course, men do not have lips or labia, but I decided to try these points anyway. In his case, I could only squeeze out a few drops of blood with difficulty. Nevertheless, after that he never had herpes again” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Herpes and HIV: From 1983-1988, I had an HIV clinic in San Francisco, and each day I treated multiple cases of herpes. When a case is severe, the blood is dark, nearly black. This treatment was highly effective when performed bi-monthly, and though the punctures were painful, patients regularly requested it. Chronic anal herpes makes bowel movements excruciating; the bleeding of Two Lips is invaluable for cooling the heat and alleviating the pain. Preventing herpes outbreaks during pregnancy: Bleeding Two Lips during the last trimester can help your patient avoid an active herpes outbreak around her due date, an outbreak that could require her to undergo a caesarean section. Dietary restriction: Overconsumption of caffeine, sugar and/or alcohol can cause high blood sugar, which may lead to outbreaks, especially among diabetics. I had one patient with extreme Liver excess who would develop a herpes outbreak after drinking only one cup of coffee. Case history (mouth sores, Dr. Lee): “A mother brought a little child to my office. The child had not been able to eat or drink for two days because of sores in her mouth. She just cried and cried. I quickly bled Two Lips. Of course, the child cried from the bleeding procedure. However, when I returned to the room, the child was standing up and asked me for a glass of water. After she drank the glass of water, she said she was hungry. I got her some crackers. In all she ate eight of these” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Thrush: Although thrush was originally listed as an indication for Two Lips, I would never consider bleeding these points for this type of candida unless it were life threatening. Strengthen the microbiome and avoid eating sugar, altogether.",

When the legs are positioned this way, a space will open between the patella and the top of the tibia. Have the patient cough each time you pierce the skin (twice on each knee). Bleed all four points quickly in sequence so that the patient is not left anticipating the treatment 315 Lower Leg Points on the opposite side. You may need to pinch the skin firmly at each point to get blood from these points, swiping one drop at a time. Ten to twenty drops per point should be effective; however, I continue bleeding up to 50 drops per point if it is bleeding easily. If you find a vein crossing this space beneath the patella, always use the vessel, Point Location and Needling Technique. Lateral bleeding: Since my early days observing in Dr. Lee’s clinic and studying with Dr. Young, and until recently in my own practice, I always bled these points on the midline just below the tip of the patella and approximately 0.5 cun distal, never realizing that the official location was on a lateral line. One time, I bled Two Lips in this midline location on a 50-year-old woman, and though there was never any infection, a small red dot remained at each point of insertion for months following the treatment, and she developed minor knee pain. Since that time I have occasionally chosen to bleed Two Lips at the lateral location, avoiding the patellar ligament, though I have found this to be less effective. If the patient is younger and the herpes is aggressive, I still use the midline location, as I did for more than 25 years without incident.",
        "comments": "Dr. Lee pioneered the selection of these points for treating herpes: “Because the names of these last two points translate as Upper and Lower Lips, and because in Chinese the labia of the vagina are called the large and small lips, I got the idea that maybe these two points might be able to treat herpes genitalia. When a doctor’s wife came in to see me with very inflamed labia due to severe herpes, I decided to try this idea. I bled the four points on both legs and black blood ran copiously out. That night, four hours later, the woman called me to say that the pain, itching, and inflammation had ceased. I told this woman to ask her husband to come in so I could treat him so that he would not simply re-infect her. He came in the next day. Of course, men do not have lips or labia, but I decided to try these points anyway. In his case, I could only squeeze out a few drops of blood with difficulty. Nevertheless, after that he never had herpes again” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Herpes and HIV: From 1983-1988, I had an HIV clinic in San Francisco, and each day I treated multiple cases of herpes. When a case is severe, the blood is dark, nearly black. This treatment was highly effective when performed bi-monthly, and though the punctures were painful, patients regularly requested it. Chronic anal herpes makes bowel movements excruciating; the bleeding of Two Lips is invaluable for cooling the heat and alleviating the pain. Preventing herpes outbreaks during pregnancy: Bleeding Two Lips during the last trimester can help your patient avoid an active herpes outbreak around her due date, an outbreak that could require her to undergo a caesarean section. Dietary restriction: Overconsumption of caffeine, sugar and/or alcohol can cause high blood sugar, which may lead to outbreaks, especially among diabetics. I had one patient with extreme Liver excess who would develop a herpes outbreak after drinking only one cup of coffee. Case history (mouth sores, Dr. Lee): “A mother brought a little child to my office. The child had not been able to eat or drink for two days because of sores in her mouth. She just cried and cried. I quickly bled Two Lips. Of course, the child cried from the bleeding procedure. However, when I returned to the room, the child was standing up and asked me for a glass of water. After she drank the glass of water, she said she was hungry. I got her some crackers. In all she ate eight of these” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Thrush: Although thrush was originally listed as an indication for Two Lips, I would never consider bleeding these points for this type of candida unless it were life threatening. Strengthen the microbiome and avoid eating sugar, altogether. ",

        "comments": "Heaven Emperor vs. 77.18 Shen Guan: I rarely needle Heaven Emperor (SP9) except in combination with Shen Guan for acid reflux or deficient frontal headache. In every other instance, I substitute 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate), Master Tung’s Master Kidney Point, as a much more powerful choice. Energetic pathways: Heaven Emperor is the He-Sea point of the Spleen and the water point on an earth channel, tonifying Spleen qi and Kidney yin. Needling close to the bone increases Kidney tonification (bone treats bone). Powerfully related to both Spleen and Kidney, all “Emperor” points (77.17-77.21) tonify both prenatal (Kidney) and postnatal (Spleen) qi. Acid reflux: Both Heaven Emperor and 77.18 Shen Guan decrease stomach acid. Because He-Sea points correct reflux in the flow of qi, and Heaven Emperor is the water point on an earth channel (cooling Stomach fire), this combination of two points is used for acid reflux and bad breath. Note: 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) has the opposite effect, increasing stomach acid. Heart disease: SP9 treats all three Jiao. Though Master Tung needled Heaven Emperor to treat heart diseases – including hypertension, dizziness, headache, insomnia and arm pain – it is used for many kinds of Kidney-related conditions, as well. Case history (heart disease, Master Tung): “Once I saw Master Tung treat a man with 95% blockage of his coronary arteries. The man’s face was purple-black. He could not do anything. He kept fidgeting, standing up and sitting down, trying to pump blood to his heart. Master Tung needled Heaven Emperor. After a while, the patient was able to breathe deeply and I saw his facial color turn bright pink. That day, that was the only needle Master Tung used on this man with such a severe condition” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Heaven Emperor with KD3: Dr. Young combines Heaven Emperor with 66.14 Water Phase (KD3), as the two points share similar energetics – one point is water in earth, and the other point is earth within water. Together, they act like the herbal formula Zhen Wu Tang (True Warrior Formula) to treat edema, diabetes, proteinuria and other diseases of the Kidney and Spleen (Dr. Young, 2008).

        "techniques": "Needle perpendicularly 0.5 - 2 cun . | Johnson: Bone-treating-bone function: Slide the needle down the back of the tibia, touching the bone. Needling close to bone enhances the Kidney tonification. Avoid the vein: A vein runs along the length of the tibia, and it is usually visible. This vessel makes 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors sensitive to needle, particularly for women (perhaps because they are more yin), so palpate gently and avoid the vein whenever possible when inserting needles. Surprisingly, these points don’t tend to bruise, and I have never seen Shen Guan or 77.19 Earth Emperor bleed. While I occasionally get a drop of blood from 77.21 Man Emperor (SP6), it is also unlikely to bruise. Perpendicular or horizontal insertion: Usually the Three Emperor points are needled perpendicularly, though occasionally they are inserted at a 45-degree angle toward the Kidney and Liver channels. This angle reduces the Kidney tonification influence by dispersing the overall effect among three channels (KD, SP, LV). Perpendicular insertion is by far the preferred choice, and it has the effect of strengthening the Heart. Dr. Young discusses angling Three Emperors needles toward the head when treating supraorbital bone pain or frontal headache; however, I prefer perpendicular insertion in these cases, too. Depth: 0.5-1.5 cun",
        "comments": "The name “Shen Guan”: “Shen Guan” translates as “Kidney Gate,” and in Tung’s acupuncture it is also referred to as Master Tung’s Master Kidney Point. All points that are “Gates” are very important points in the body, such as PC6 Nei Guan, SJ5 Wai Guan and 77.27 Wai San Guan, though Shen Guan is far more powerful than any of the others. Heaven, Earth and Man: Shen Guan is acting as Heaven Emperor in most of my treatments, so I will take the opportunity here to point out that Master Tung chose to name and order multiple point patterns in his family’s system differently, as compared to their usual sequence of Heaven, Man and Earth. This is because Master Tung was a Taoist, and he recognized that of the three, Man is the least and is supported by both Heaven and Earth, and therefore Man should be on the bottom. We see this in two other point patterns: 33.13-33.15 Heaven, Earth and Man Scholars and 44.08-44.10 Heaven, Earth and Man Ancestors. Energetic pathways: Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) and Three Emperors, Kidney points found on the Spleen channel, are unique in that they are the only points in Tung’s acupuncture that address four major systems – digestive, neurological, reproductive and urinary – in a remarkably powerful way. Shen Guan also has a cardiac influence due to its Reaction Areas of Heart and Kidney (Hand and Foot Shao Yin), and it can be used to treat arteriosclerosis. Shen Guan regulates earth and water to treat all diseases caused by Kidney deficiency. It tonifies Spleen and Kidney and has the unusual ability to benefit qi while tonifying yin, accomplishing this by strengthening the Spleen (earth) to restrain the Kidney (water), much like a dam holds back a lake. The Spleen governs postnatal qi, and the Kidney governs prenatal qi. When treating chronic conditions, always consider adding Shen Guan, since chronic diseases usually have a deficient Kidney component. However, when there is Kidney deficiency, we reduce the number of needles used, so you may want to omit other points when adding Shen Guan. In some instances, the special relationship between the Foot Tai Yin (Spleen) and Hand Tai Yang (Small Intestine) comes into play, such as when treating upper back or shoulder pain, neuropathy in the hands, deafness, tinnitus, or trigeminal neuralgia. For all of the reasons described here, Shen Guan is among the most commonly needled points in Tung’s acupuncture. Three Emperors: In my clinic, “classic” Three Emperors is comprised of 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate), 77.19 Earth Emperor and 77.21 Man Emperor (Tung’s SP6). These points are one of Master Tung’s primary Dao Ma combinations used to strengthen both Kidney and Spleen function, and they are indicated to treat pathological changes due to Kidney deficiency. All Three Emperors points are needled bilaterally when an additional boost is needed for the treatment or when the treatment is specifically directed toward the lower legs and feet. Two Emperors: When combining Emperor points with other powerful point patterns, we often omit the middle point (Earth Emperor) in order to consolidate the treatment and reduce the number of needles. When the middle point is not needled, the combination of Shen Guan and Man Emperor is referred to as Two Emperors. Shen Guan or Heaven Emperor (proximal point): Although Tung’s textbook includes 77.17 Heaven Emperor, it is rarely chosen as a part of the classic Three Emperors treatment. Instead, 77.18 Shen Guan is nearly always substituted, as it is a much more powerful Kidney tonification point. Earth Emperor (middle point): The location of the middle point, 77.19 Earth Emperor, varies based upon the location chosen for the distal point, Man Emperor. For this reason it is considered to be a floating point found halfway between Shen Guan and Man Emperor (or the point substituted for Man Emperor; see below). Man Emperor (distal point): In all written sources, 77.21 Man Emperor is said to be the same as Textbook SP6 San Yin Jiao. However, I was taught that Master Tung officially found Man Emperor one cun proximal to Textbook SP6, and so it is referred to as Upper San Yin Jiao. This is the location that I most frequently utilize. Three additional points can be substitutes for Man Emperor (based upon varying uses); these would change its location and therefore also the location of Earth Emperor. Man Emperor substitutions include: 323 Lower Leg Points Textbook SP6: Textbook SP6 San Yin Jiao is a very powerful crossing point of the Liver, Kidney and Spleen channels (hence the name, Three Yin Crossing), and so it cannot be underestimated. According to many sources, this point is in the textbook location of Man Emperor. 77.28 Bright Light (Tung’s KD7): If we are utilizing the Three Emperors points in treatments for the eyes, we always substitute 77.28 Bright Light for Man Emperor. Bright Light is found at the same level as KD7 Fu Liu, but is directly behind the tibia on the Spleen channel. Textbook KD7: Textbook KD7 is found just anterior to the medial Achilles tendon, and it too may be used as a substitute for Man Emperor, especially in cases of extremely dry throat and mouth. 77.20 Four Limbs: All sources on Tung’s acupuncture cite 77.20 Four Limbs in the same location as Upper San Yin Jiao, Tung’s Man Emperor. Three Emperors vs. 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points: Kidney Passing Points, also Kidney points found on the Spleen channel, are mainly considered in cases of whole- body edema, nephritis or threatened miscarriage. Three Emperors have more of a gynecological, sexual and neurological function and are better for impotence and premature ejaculation. Both Three Emperors and the Kidney Passing Points are good for dry mouth, as they help the Kidney to control fluids and strengthen the kidneys in general. Three Emperors are a better choice for proteinuria, especially in cases of diabetes, preeclampsia, urinary infections or rheumatoid arthritis. They are essential in the treatment of menopausal hot flashes and night sweats, hypertension, diabetes and Kidney-deficient eye diseases. Sexual and urinary function: To treat premature ejaculation, we needle Shen Guan (Kidney Gate), because in this instance the Ming Men is not consolidated, and Shen Guan astringes and fortifies the Kidney Gate. It connects UB23 Shen Shu and REN4 Guan Yuan and is therefore useful in the treatment of premature ejaculation, impotence, incontinence, and frequent urination. See Combinations below for extensive urinary treatments. Urinary incontinence (Dr. Lee): “The Kidneys and Lungs work together as a pair in terms of water metabolism. If the Lungs are functioning correctly, one can hold their urine without any trouble. If the Lungs are weak in the elderly, this may lead to incontinence when they laugh, sneeze, or cough. Such incontinence is not a Kidney/ Bladder problem but a Lung problem. One should supplement the Lungs (child) by supplementing the Spleen and Stomach (mother)” (Dr. Lee, 1992). In terms of incontinence, most elderly patients also have Kidney deficiency in addition to Lung weakness. Note: I recently read an article in a journal of Chinese Medicine about why patients urinate often at night, and why it becomes more frequent as they get older. The article offered the theory that the prone body helps the kidneys to process toxins from the blood, whereas during the day the blood tends to pool in the lower body as the patient remains upright. We can moxa or apply moxa oil on the lower back (Ming Men) and from the pubic bone to the navel (to tonify the Dan Tian). Usually we do not moxa above the navel (except for severe kidney edema), as we do not want to dry out the digestion. Formulas: Liu Wei Di Huang (Six Ingredients) is especially good for yin deficient patients who are thirsty or constipated. If the tongue is pale with teeth marks, we cannot use Liu Wei Di Huang alone, but need to add Fu Zi and Rou Gui, resulting in the formula known as Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan (Golden Book Tea), to tonify Kidney yin and yang. Elderly patients should eat Semen Nelumbinis Nuciferae (Lian Zi) to supplement the Lungs, in order to help them hold in their water. Urinary tract infection (UTI): This textbook provides a great deal of information regarding UTI. See both 11.17 Wood (Anger) and the discussion of interstitial cystitis with 66.02 Wood Wife. •  Treatments: My most frequent treatments include 11.17 Wood (Anger) and 66.02 Wood Wife, along with 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors, 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water and REN4 Guan Yuan. •  Irritability: I may add LI4/LV3 Four Gates to open the nervous system and calm the spirit, though 66.03 Fire Hardness (LV2) may be substituted because it is the Ying-Spring and fire point on the Liver meridian which flows through the genitals, and thus it clears heat. (Note: When substituting LV2, I always pair it with LI3 San Jian, also known as Anxiety Four Gates.)•  Lower jiao heat: If the patient has good veins to bleed between the medialmalleolus and SP6 San Yin Jiao, these may also be useful. •  For bladder pain and/or spasms: Bleeding the Koryo Hand Therapy A-line (referenced in 66.02 Wood Wife) will be mmediately effective. •  Urethralgia: Choose from the following points: 66.03 Fire Hardness, 66.04 Fire Master; 22.05 Ling Gu; 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water; 11.01 Great Distance with 11.04 External Distance; 44.11 Yun Bai, 44.12 Li Bai.•  Formulas: For chronic bladder infections, patients should be advised to drink corn silk tea all of the time, instead of water, to flush the bladder and soothe irritation. The usual formulas for acute UTI are Ba Zheng San and Long Dan Xie Gan Tang, or Ba Zheng San with Zhu Ling Tang, but all of these are a little too cold for chronic issues. For both acute and chronic bladder infections, use Si Ni San (Chai Wu, Chi Shi, Shao Yao, Gan Cao) with Jie Geng and Fu Ling to descend the water. Dr. Young doesn’t usually use Ban Lan Gun or Pu Gong Ying, but he uses Jie Geng and Shi Gao to clear heat and kill microbes. Kidney infections need heavier herbs like Mu Li, Gui Ban, Long Gu and/or HuangQin and Huang Lian, which are bitter and cold to clear heat and dampness. These herbs are not to be used long term or with nephritis due to kidney failure (glomerulonephritis).•  Hematuria formulas: Xiao Ji Yin Zi or Zhu Ling Tang. •  Prostate enlargement is a Kidney-deficient condition where the enlarged prostate presses on the urethra, making it difficult to urinate. This usually causes dribbling or the inability to make a smooth stream of urine and is a problem for most men over age seventy. Classic texts advise to needle SP9 followed by ST36 to cause a strong flow of urine (see Combinations below for treatment options). If the patient is urinating between six and twelve times per night, I usually recommend a surgical procedure to remedy the situation quickly and efficiently. •  Anti-histamines: I once gave an elderly gentleman an antihistamine herbal formula for his cold. Shortly thereafter he was unable to urinate and required an emergency room visit. Since that time, I am extremely wary of using antihistamines for patients who might have an enlarged prostate. •  Case history (enlarged prostate and macular degeneration): I am working with a 71-year-old who lost one kidney due to cancer and who is also losing his eyesight due to cystic macular degeneration. We discussed the prospect of prostate surgery because his nocturia had become problematic at six times per night. As his eyes are improving with treatment, he is also urinating only twice a night now. I attribute the prostate improvement to Kidney tonification from the treatment that I am using for his eyes (55.02 Flower Bone One with 77.18-77.28 Three Emperors). This change occurred within three weeks of beginning treatment. •  Prostate combinations:•  Bilaterally needle 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water, 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors, and deeply needle one of the following: REN3 Zhong Ji, REN4 Guan Yuan or REN6 Qi Hai (sea of qi, tonifies Kidneys, releases stagnation in lower jiao). When needling is deep on the lower REN channel, the patient may feel “something going down,” or a “zing” into the genital area. Though they may not feel it, always prepare your patients for this, because they will be startled if it happens and they are not prepared. •  Moxa UB23 Shen Shu, DU4 Ming Men, REN6 Qi Hai and/or REN4 Guan Yuan.•  Bilaterally needle 66.04 Fire Master, 77.17 Heaven Emperor (SP9), sedate 77.08 Four Flower pper (ST36) to promote immediate urination. SP9 and ST36 are both He-Sea points tonifying earth to build water.•  Bilaterally needle 22.05 Ling Gu with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors.•  Bilaterally needle 88.13 Heavenly Yellow, 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) (Dr. Young, lectures, 1998).•  Bilaterally needle 44.06 Shoulder Center, 44.11 Cloud White, 44.15 Lower Curve (Dr. Young, lectures, 1998).•  Bilaterally needle 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master. •  UB65 Shu Gu (the wood point on the Urinary Bladder channel).•  LV1 Da Dun can be used as a Guiding Point with any of the above treatments. •  Dietary recommendations and herbs for enlarged prostate: For those whose nocturia is fewer than six times nightly, the following dietary recommendations may be helpful: eat raw pumpkin seeds (up to one pound daily; they can be ground into a meal/powder); it is also good to eat chestnuts, apples and bee pollen. I usually prescribe Pau d’Arco, Kai Kit Wan or Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan. •  Formulas: For the elderly with deficient Kidney fire, use Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan. With qi and yin deficiencies, use Gui Zhi Fu Ling with Jin Gui Shen Qi and herbs to soften masses, like Xia Ku Cao, Kun Bu, Hai Zao, Mu Li.•  Prostatitis: This condition is usually caused by damp heat in the Liver and Gallbladder and occurs in younger or middle-aged men. It is characterized by radiating medial thigh pain, blood in the semen and sometimes tailbone pain. If it is chronic or Kidney qi deficient, there may be a white discharge. •  Prostatitis combinations:•  Bilaterally needle 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master, 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors.•  Bilaterally bleed small veins from the medial malleolus up to SP6 San Yin Jiao (insert the bleeding needle or lancet at an angle to avoid striking the tibia). Unilaterally needle left-side 11.01 Great Distance, 11.02 Small Distance; bilaterally needle LV1 Da Dun as a Guiding Point (Dr. Young, 2008).•  Dietary advice for prostatitis: Patients should eat apples, tomatoes, seaweed, oyster shell and zinc. •  Formulas: For damp heat, use Si Ni San with Zhi Bai Di Huang or Long Dan Xie Gan Tang with Bei Xie. For radiating pain, use Chuan Lian Zi, Li Zhi He, Yan Hu Suo and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. For Kidney qi deficiency with chronic white discharge, use Shen Qi Wan with Yi Mu Cao. With blood in the semen and radiating pain, use Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan with Pu Huang and Wu Ling Zi or Gui Zhi Fu Ling and Ru Xiang, Mu Yao, Chuan Shan Jia, Di Long.•  Edema:•  Heart: When edema is heart related, it may show up on only one leg, or on both legs. Fluid may leak from acupuncture needle sites when the situation is severe. Chronic leg edema may be due to Kidney weakness in addition to the Heart; for that reason, we use Spleen and Kidney herbs and choose from both Heart and Kidney points listed below:•  For heart-related edema in the legs and feet: Use Spleen and Kidney herbs and the following points: 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points; 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors with 88.03 Passing Heaven; 77.18 Shen Guan with 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36); Formulas for heart failure: Shen Fu Long Gu Mu Li Tang with Sheng Mai San or Zhen Wu Tang with Sheng Mai San.•  Kidney: Edema in the lower legs due to kidney failure or disease can be difficult to treat, and serious. We usually do not moxa above the navel, as this can be too drying, but in the case of edema due to kidney failure, moxa REN9 Shui Fen (the primary TCM point for edema). Facial edema relates to Kidney, though severe kidney disease may or may not involve facial swelling. •  Treatments may include: Bilateral 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points; 77.17 Heaven Emperor (SP9) (He-Sea/water point on an earth channel) or 77.18-77.28 Two or Three Emperors (using either 77.21 Man Emperor or 77.28 Bright Light); 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors with 88.03 Passing Heaven and 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai to treat swollen, edematous limbs. Bleed 44.17 Water Healing to strengthen the kidneys, for edema, nephritis and proteinuria; 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) can be used to induce urination as it is the He-Sea/earth point on an earth channel, and earth controls water.•  Formulas: For chronic edema, use Zhen Wu Tang. Other possibilities: Gui Zhi Shao Yao Zhi Mu Tang with Zhen Wu Tang or Shen Fu Tang with Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang. These formulas can be used for either heart-related or kidney-related edema.•  Whole body: When the whole body is holding water, it may be due to both Heart and Kidney. 44.08-44.10 Three Ancestors treats whole-body edema (due to both Heart and Kidney). However, Three Ancestors are rarely used due to complications in locating and needling. See point choices above for both Heart and Kidney edema.•  Liver: Ascities or abdominal edema relates to the Liver. See 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows. Dietary advice for edema: Ask your patient to eat adzuki beans cooked with barley to help move the water. A bone broth can be used to cook them. If the patient cannot eat multiple bowls per day, they can blend the mixture into a warm drink that can be chugged. This will help reduce water retention without weakening the patient. •  Diuretics such as Lasix should be used as a last resort, as they squeeze the kidneys to remove excess water. If the person is in a weakened state, this could actually hasten their demise. Once patients are having needle aspiration to remove fluids, they are considered end stage. Fluids aspirated in this way will be quickly replaced. I had an end-stage cirrhosis patient who received needle aspiration twice for her ascites, before I was able to get on top of her liver disease with 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows and 11.20 Wood Inflammation. That was three years ago, and she is still alive today. •  Kidney failure (formulas): See Edema: Kidney Comments, above, for point combinations. Dong Chong Xia Cao (cordyceps) in a dosage of 6-9 grams daily for one to three weeks, then two times per week, is very helpful for any kind of kidney failure. With qi and yin deficiency, use Shen Qi Mai Wei Di Huang. For Spleen and Kidney yang deficiency, use Zhen Wu Tang. •  Edema due to kidney failure: Moxa on REN9 Shui Fen is the best treatment for this kind of edema. •  Failure to urinate: This condition indicates either a severely enlarged prostate (can be emergent when antihistamines are used) or kidney failure. •  Salt pouch: Using a salt pouch to warm the navel can promote urination, though with complete kidney failure, a salt pouch is not strong enough. Use moxa, as described below. •  Moxa on the navel: For difficulty urinating due to kidney failure, use moxa on the navel. Line the belly button with a thin paper and fill it with salt. Then, cover the salt with a thin slice of ginger that has been pierced many times with a fork. Burn five large moxa balls (or ten stick-on moxa cones) until the salt melts. •  Note: I learned this treatment in Dr. Lee’s clinic long before stick-on moxa was available. We hand-pressed moxa into balls for the above procedure. I witnessed multiple patients who were already on dialysis and unable to urinate begin to void again after the moxa treatment. In my own clinic, a patient with kidney failure also returned to urinating after moxibustion. Success with this protocol depends upon the severity of the kidney failure. For my patient, it was acute, not chronic. I had one patient with severe chronic kidney failure, for whom this treatment did not work.•  Bed-wetting: When the tip of the little finger does not reach the palmar line of the last joint on the ring finger, this indicates a genetic Kidney deficiency. Many children who were born prematurely have a problem with bed-wetting, a sign of Kidney deficiency. It is common for them to be fearful. The best treatment is to moxa from REN4 Guan Yuan to REN8 Shen Que (the navel). Salt pouch (for home treatment): This treatment is also used for failure to thrive and has been enormously helpful to me, personally, in my practice. Have the child’s parents sew a small non-flammable pouch and fill it with rock salt. This pouch can be heated in the microwave to tolerance. Also have them stitch a small felt pocket that has a Velcro enclosure on the top edge and attach it to a belt (also made of felt), and add a Velcro clasp. Place the heated salt pouch in the pocket, then strap it around the baby or toddler (or elder child who is bed wetting), over the navel, with the Velcro clasp in the back where the child cannot reach it. Be absolutely sure that the salt is hot, but not so hot that it burns. The pouch may be worn until it cools, or approximately forty-five minutes to one hour per session. Because this treatment is so comforting to the child, it may be done multiple times per day and continued until there is a reduction in enuresis. This treatment has been a godsend when used for infants who projectile vomit or do not roll over within a reasonable time, or for those who show any other signs of delayed development. The parents can decide how long to provide this treatment for their child, a good rule of thumb might be four to six weeks beyond the resumption of normal development or healthy digestion. Additionally, the salt pouch may be turned to the child’s back to heat the DU4 Ming Men – UB23 Shen Shu area. •  For older children: Bilaterally needle 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors, 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water, 22.05 Ling Gu or 77.17 Heaven Emperor (SP9) with 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36).•  Shoulder pain: Shen Guan is frequently chosen to treat frozen shoulder or typical shoulder pain due to its wonderful ability to reach both the front and back of the shoulder in two very potent ways. Firstly, due to the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yin (SP) connection, it treats the front of the shoulder (LU1-LU2 area). Secondly, due to the special relationship between the Foot Tai Yin (Spleen) and Hand Tai Yang (Small Intestine), Kidney Gate can be used to treat the back of the shoulder. Please see 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) for a detailed description of frozen shoulder treatment.•  Eye diseases: Although I always start any treatment for the eyes with 55.02 Flower Bone One, the Two or Three Emperors points are also exceptional when strengthening the power of vision is required. In these cases, I always substitute 77.28 Bright Light (Tung’s KD7) for 77.21 Man Emperor, adding GB20 and GB37 for a dynamite eye treatment. •  Case history (herpes in the eye): When treating herpes in the eye, once all of the above-listed needles are placed, I bleed the Koryo Hand Therapy (KHT) Eye and Head Points on the ends of the middle fingers – a truly miraculous treatment for restoring clear vision. My patient with this problem experienced what he called “cotton balls,” puffy white clouds in his visual field; these were white blood cells in the area that were attempting to fight the virus. His affected eye was red and he had difficulty focusing his vision. After only three treatments, including KHT bleeding techniques, his “bad” eye was seeing as well as his “good” eye. When treating a viral condition, it is necessary to continue treatment long after the improvement of symptoms, at least quarterly and perhaps indefinitely. For this patient, I also prescribed Ultra Vir-X by Biotics Research, and Dendrobium Night Sight Pills (Shihu Yeguang Wan) to bring the anti-viral formula to the eyes. •  Menopausal hot flashes and night sweats: One of my all-time favorite uses for Shen Guan and Two or Three Emperors is in the treatment of miserable menopausal women. If a woman is exiting fertility gracefully (asymptomatically), I do not encourage hormonal activity by providing unnecessary treatment. If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it; it’s far better to leave well enough alone. However, in extreme cases, if a woman is sweating all night and “suffocating” all day, she will really appreciate the following treatment: 11.17 Wood (Anger), 11.24 Gynecological Points, 11.06 Return to the Nest, 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors, and LI4/LV3 Four Gates, in that order. If insomnia, depression or anxiety are also part of the picture, I frequently add the Prefrontal Scalp Points. •  Spleen points during pregnancy: Most Spleen channel points are contraindicated during pregnancy; however, Shen Guan may be an exception to that rule. Although some sources discourage its use, it is not officially forbidden. Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment, when modified for pregnancy, substitutes Shen Guan for SP6 San Yin Jiao (definitely contraindicated) and excludes LI4 He Gu. I have been using this combination for my pregnant patients for more than thirty years with fantastic results. Because the Kidneys are so utterly taxed during gestation, this treatment is enormously restorative. Once the baby has been delivered, Two or Three Emperors points will strengthen and consolidate the poor tired Kidneys and are a very important part of postpartum care. For this, Shen Guan is unsurpassed. Moxa is also extremely useful in postpartum care; please see Mother Roasting: The Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Post Partum Care by Raven Lang, OMD. Do not over-treat in pregnancy; only do what is required.•  Preeclampsia (toxemia) is marked by an increase in blood pressure and protein in the urine after the 20th week of pregnancy. Check your pregnant patient’s blood pressure every time you treat her, so you can establish a baseline and will know if her pressure starts to increase. Should the blood pressure rise during pregnancy, acupuncture treatment will be less important than prescribing the correct herbal formula to tonify Kidney yin and xtinguish Liver wind. I have had great success treating this condition using a powerful herbal formula and Shen Guan. •  Hypertension: Two or Three Emperors points are very helpful in treating Kidney-deficient-type hypertension. In my experience, when the blood pressure rises toward the late afternoon, it is associated with deficiency of the Kidneys. It could be Liver excess, as well, especially if the blood pressure is also exceptionally high upon awakening in the morning. Needling Two or Three Emperors to consolidate and strengthen Kidney qi gently lowers blood pressure. I often bleed 99.08 Ear Apex, too, when blood pressure hovers around 150/100. If a patient’s blood pressure is higher than that, I am more aggressive and may bleed the fingertips, 77.08-77.14 Four Flower Line and/or DT.04 Five Mountain Range. When a patient’s diastolic pressure exceeds 100, I seriously consider sending them immediately to the emergency room for blood pressure medication, as soon as I have dropped their blood pressure with these kinds of bleeding treatments. I would rather they take blood pressure medications and then discontinue them safely, over time, than risk any kind of cerebrovascular accident. Be sure to follow up with these patients. •  Hypotension: “Sometimes after needling Two Emperors, the patient will experience orthostatic hypotension when they stand up. If this happens, immediately supplement ST36 Zu San Li and it will be relieved” (Dr. Lee, 1992). For this reason, I am very careful in needling the Emperors points when blood pressure is already low or when there has been excessive blood loss.•  Frontal headache (deficient type): To diagnose a deficient frontal headache, ask the patient to press gently on their eyeballs with warm fingers. If it is a deficient-type headache, they will like the pressure. For this type of headache, needle the Spleen channel, combining Shen Guan and 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) and/or 66.10 Fire Connection (SP3). Shen Guan is acting as the He-Sea point of the Spleen channel, though SP9 may be substituted. 66.10 Fire Connection (SP3) is the Yuan-Source and Shu-Stream point of the Spleen meridian, so it is good for pain and heaviness of the head. 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (Tung’s SP4) is the Luo Connecting point and opens the Chong Mai. 66.10 and 66.11 are needled using a 30mm needle and the curving needle technique to wrap around the bone. Because a deficient frontal headache could be considered a tired or blood-deficient headache, also consider implementing Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment. See 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) for additional information related to diagnosis and for treatment of excess-type frontal headaches.•  Combining points with Shen Guan: Shen Guan regulates the Spleen when combined with 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36), and tonifies the Kidneys when combined with KD7 Fu Liu. When treating Kidney and Spleen deficiency, choose either Three Emperors or 77.17 Heaven Emperor with 66.14 Water Phase (KD3) (Dr. Young, 2008). •  Acid reflux or stomach ulcer: Both Shen Guan and 77.17 Heaven Emperor decrease stomach acid. Because He-Sea points correct reflux in the flow of qi, and Heaven Emperor is the water point on an earth channel (cooling Stomach fire), this combination of two points is used for acid reflux and bad breath. Note: 77.08 Four Flower Upper (ST36) has the opposite effect, increasing stomach acid.•  Case history (gas and shoulder pain, Renaud): “A patient arrived complaining of one-sided shoulder pain that would be alleviated when she burped. She was a singer who had been diagnosed with acid reflux, which affected her voice. She had told her doctors that she felt her shoulder pain and her acid reflux symptoms seemed interrelated, but they told her there was no connection. Since I knew Shen Guan would treat both conditions, I needled it on the opposite-side leg that day and she felt better immediately.” •  Case history (diabetic neuropathy): Three Emperors are primary in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy because they tonify Spleen qi and Kidney yin. I once had a patient whose feet were so sensitive he could not have the weight of a sheet placed over them. First, I treated the feet with gentle Gua Sha (oil and rubbing with a finger), and then added bilateral Three Emperors. After one treatment, his feet were eighty percent better. After the second treatment, his oncologist called me to find out what I was doing. •  Neuropathy: When treating neuropathy, it is always important to know its origin. Numbness in the extremities can be caused by multiple factors, such as: stenosis or bone spurring, high cholesterol, hypertension, pharmaceuticals, or diabetes, each requiring a different approach. When the numbness comes from the Heart, choose 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing points. If the numbness is related to medications that the patient is continuing to take, there is no point in treating it. If it is due to chemotherapy agents, simply wait to address it until chemotherapy finishes; also be sure to thoroughly cup the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas at that time. •  Note: If there are bone spurs in the cervical vertebrae that are causing neuropathy, see 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One for the bone spur protocol.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Textbook Man Emperor, in the location of traditional SP6 San Yin Jiao, has the Reaction Area of Kidney. I usually needle Man Emperor (Tung’s SP6) as Upper San Yin Jiao, one cun proximal to textbook SP6 (placing it in the same location as 77.20 Four Limbs). The use of this location brings with it the additional Reaction Areas of Heart and Four Limbs, strengthening the Hand and Foot Shao Yin (HT/KD) connection and lending to it an even stronger influence on blood, blood vessels and circulation. For these reasons, 77.18 Shen Guan and Man Emperor (also known as Two Emperors) are frequently used to treat arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease. These points are needled as close to the back of the tibia as possible. There is usually a dark blood vessel here, and it is hard to avoid; needling this vessel also contributes to the points’ efficacy in treating heart disease via the vessel-treating-vessel system. Similarly, needling the Emperors points close to the bone also activates the bone-treating-bone system, enhancing their overall Kidney tonification effects. This is particularly useful with any kind of chronic condition, including bone and bone marrow disorders, weakness in the lower limbs, deficient infertility, postpartum weakness, recovery after surgical procedures or chemotherapy, etc. The power of Man Emperor (Tung’s SP6) is also derived from its proximity to classic SP6, the crossing point of the Spleen, Liver and Kidney. •  Two or Three Emperors: Man Emperor is often needled as a Supporting Point to 77.18 Shen Guan in the combination known as Two Emperors, or with both Shen Guan and 77.19 Earth Emperor in the combination known as Three Emperors. (See 77.18 Shen Guan, Comments: Three Emperors.)•  Bleeding to treat stagnation of the lower jiao: There is a very convenient treatment for lower jiao stagnation, taught to me by Dr. Young. Look for the small veins (even spider veins) found in the area between SP6 and the medial malleolus. Bleeding these smaller vessels, usually with a lancet or hypodermic needle tip, is very effective for infertility, bladder infections, genital herpes outbreaks, and lower jiao conditions caused by wet heat. When treating a bladder infection, though the above treatment may be helpful, bleeding Koryo Hand Therapy A-line in the area of the hand/heel point is extraordinarily effective (see 66.02 Wood Wife, Comments on interstitial cystitis for further information). I am less inclined to use this treatment for bacterial dysentery. •  Caution: It is difficult to avoid tapping the tibia with the tip of your bleeding needle. Be very conscious of this, and if you must contact the bone, be sure to do it extremely gently. For this reason, I usually avoid using a spring-loaded lancet in this area, and instead use a hand-held instrument and puncture at a 45-degree angle.",

Leg Thousand Gold and Leg Five Gold (also referred to as Leg Five/One Thousand Gold) additionally treat wind and phlegm, and have the Reaction Areas of Kidney, Lung and Thyroid. “Gold” in the name of these points implies metal, referring to Lung and Large Intestine. The following discussions illustrate the many different energetic pathways utilized by these points, which powerfully tonify metal to control wood.•  Hyperthyroid: I love to use these points for hyperthyroid, especially gestational hyperthyroid, which can be difficult to treat. When the Heart and Liver fire are rising in pregnancy, we must sedate very carefully in order to protect the fetus. Because these Gallbladder points utilize the special relationship between the Foot Shao Yang (GB)and the Hand Shao Yin (HT), they also connect the Hand and Foot Shao Yin (HT/KD), and so we see the Reaction Area of Kidney. These wonderful points are capable of gently draining fire from the Heart and Liver, while nourishing the Kidneys to stop sweating and hold the fetus. •  Goiter: Thyroid enlargement can relate to either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. With the Reaction Areas of Thyroid and Lung, these points connect to the Hand and Foot Yang Ming (LI/ST) passing through the throat and neck, which relate to the accumulation of qi and phlegm in the neck. Because of the internal/external relationship of Lung and Large Intestine, as well as the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and Foot Jue Yin (LV), we additionally address both internal and external wind as it relates to the throat (laryngitis/sore throat), as well as phlegm (goiter). •  Frozen shoulder: Leg Five/One Thousand Gold points are frequently part of my protocol for treating a frozen shoulder, as they implement all of the relationships discussed above. Affecting both the Lung and Large Intestine channels locally (difficulty moving the shoulder forward or backward), they also address tendons and ligaments through their relationship to the Liver and Gallbladder, and via the Shao Yang, the San Jiao (Hand Shao Yang) which powerfully affects the shoulder, elbow, arm, wrist and hand.•  Gastroenteritis: Due to the internal connection between the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians and the internal/external connection between the Lung and Large Intestine, these points treat acute intestinal inflammation. Clinically, I use these points primarily for frozen shoulder, thyroid, and throat diseases, and would likely choose other points (such as 77.08-77.14 Four Flower Line/Stomach channel; or 66.05 Golden Gate, 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum, PC6 Nei Guan) to treat intestinal inflammation.•  Sore throat: These points can be used for sore throat, swollen throat, fish bone stuck in the throat, goiter or any other throat issue. However, for sore throat, I usually bleed either LU11 or LI1 bilaterally, or palpate the throat for areas of thickness (implying congestion) and bleed locally. I pinch up the loose skin on the throat before puncturing, then squeeze/swipe the blood until the throat pain is gone.

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Outer Three Gates can treat dermatological diseases because “Outer” implies an exterior function, and also because of the Lung Reaction Area. For the same reason, they can treat acne, tonsillitis, and neck and shoulder pain, especially when there is an inability to move the shoulder forward and backward (similar to 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold). Because I use Outer Three Gates primarily to treat cancer found anywhere in the body, I would not choose them in the treatment of other conditions unless the patient also has cancer, as there are so many other great points for all other indications. Cancer: It is important to know the legal restrictions of your license if you are treating a patient who has been diagnosed with a malignancy. In California, it is illegal for acupuncturists to treat cancer; however, we frequently treat patients who are receiving allopathic care and also request support from TCM. We have many ways of treating the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, including detoxifying the body before beginning and after the conclusion of those treatments. I do not use Outer Three Gates unless there is malignancy, as benign tumors are better treated with points specific to their location. Directing the treatment: When I use Outer Three Gates to treat tumors, I always start by needling points that direct the treatment to the affected area. For example, in the treatment of a malignant brain tumor, I would first needle 55.06 Upper Tumor, followed by Outer Three Gates (alternating with 77.05-77.07 Three Weights). When malignancy is in the bladder, I first needle 1010.13-1010.14 Horse Gold Water/Horse Fast Water and then Outer Three Gates. If I were treating stomach cancer, I might needle 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43) along with Outer Three Gates (avoiding ST36). For female reproductive cancers, begin with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. In cases of Liver cancer, begin with 11.20 Wood Inflammation. Frequency: Outer Three Gates points may be needled daily, as they do not interfere with chemotherapy or radiation treatment. If there is an appropriate family member (licensed practitioner), I teach them to needle these points so they can easily be treated on a daily basis. Mitigating side effects: Whenever I am treating a patient who is undergoing chemotherapy, I carefully study in advance the particular agents that will be used, with the intention of strengthening and protecting any tissues that are typically inflamed or damaged by that agent. For example, if a chemotherapy drug causes mouth ulcers, I may bleed either LU5 or the Stomach channel to clear heat and/ or recommend the regular use of Edgar Cayce’s Ipsab. If the chemotherapy agent causes peripheral neuropathy, I will usually implement the bilateral needling of 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, etc. Side effects can be so severe that I highly recommend getting a jump on them. Sometimes it is hard to know whether it is the cancer or the cancer treatment that kills the patient. Take heart, be brave and compassionate, and do not give up too soon. However, if the patient has an open window to fly away, I always inform them of this option, as mourning family members tend to cling to them. Never push. ",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Bright Light (Tung’s KD7) is the metal and Jing-River point on a water channel. It tonifies the Kidney and the water element in general, to build wood. While the anatomy of the eye is governed by the Liver (wood), the power of vision comes from the Kidneys. Eye diseases: Bright Light is substituted for 77.21 Man Emperor whenever I am using the Dao Ma pattern 77.18-77.21 Two or Three Emperors in the treatment of eye diseases. (For more information, please see 55.02 Flower Bone One and 77.18 Shen Guan, Three Emperors, Comments). Glaucoma: If I am treating glaucoma in a patient younger than 60 years old, I usually treat 55.02 Flower Bone One combined with 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/Four Flower Middle. For elderly patients, I am more likely to use 55.02 Flower Bone One with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, GB20 Feng Chi and GB37 Guang Ming. If the patient presses on their eyeballs with their warm fingers and finds this uncomfortable, use 77.08-77.09 Four Flower Upper/ Four Flower Middle instead. Floaters: For treating floaters in the field of vision, use 77.18 Shen Guan, 77.28 Bright Light (Tung’s KD7) (modified Two Emperors) with A.04 San Cha Three and 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43). Commentary (Dr. Lee): “Bright Light treats similar eye problems as 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) with which it is often used. Such eye problems, including floaters, have to do with both the Liver and the Kidneys. Eye diseases can be difficult to treat, especially if due to diabetes. Sometimes I prefer to use GB20 Feng Chi that helps to nourish the optic nerves” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

On thin, elderly legs, you will often contact the femur upon needling; go slowly and gently so as not to damage the periosteum, remembering that bone is very sensitive. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: ST32 and blood vessels: ST32 Fu Tu is located between 88.01 and 88.02, and is lateral to these two points. In The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, ST32 is called the meeting point of blood vessels and luo meridians, indicating that this point strongly regulates blood vessels, which makes it very useful for cardiac patients (Dr. Carson, 1973; Dr. Young, 2008). Heart Reaction Area: All three points have the Reaction Area of the Heart and are used to tonify the Spleen and Stomach. The two upper points, 88.02 Passing Mountain and 88.03 Passing Heaven, are especially good for heart disease and circulation; the two lower points, 88.01 Passing Gate and 88.02 Passing Mountain, have a very powerful regulatory effect on the Stomach. These points tonify fire to generate earth, and thereby regulate qi, blood and circulation. Stomach and Pericardium: Due to the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC), these points are used to strengthen the heart, blood, blood vessels and circulation, and they also have indications related to the stomach. “Passing Gate” indicates a relationship to PC6 Nei Guan (Dr. Young, 2008). These points pass through the Inner Gate to the Heart. Heart (fire), Liver (wood), Spleen (earth) and Kidney (water) all relate to blood; this explains the indications of heart disease, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, gastritis and weakness. Leg pain and weakness: I find these points to be extraordinary in the treatment of elderly patients with coronary heart disease and seriously compromised circulation resulting in extreme weakness, cold, pain or numbness in the lower body. I treated an 88-year-old woman who was unable to walk across her kitchen without extreme pain in both legs. Her feet were nearly black with small veins (larger than spider veins). Within two treatments her pain was reduced by eighty percent. She now walks to the mailbox to get her mail and rides her stationary bike 20 minutes every day. Her treatments not only benefited her, but also enabled her to care for her husband with late stage Parkinson’s, allowing them both to remain in their home. Note: Dr. Lee once said, “Lack of strength in the arms and legs is due to heart weakness. This may be, in turn, due to excessive cold or overdosing with heart disease medication”. Rheumatoid arthritis: These are the primary constitutional points used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. If the patient has one or two painful joints in the extremities, we can choose from many points to treat each joint directly. However, if all the joints hurt or the whole body aches, it is a circulation issue, with qi and blood stagnation due to deficiency or phlegm. Found between the Stomach and Spleen channels, the Heart Passing Points have a strong effect on phlegm in the body (phlegm in the joints, phlegm obstructing the brain). The Heart Passing Points are more beneficial than points related to bone, though frequently we touch the femur when needling these 359 Lower Leg Points points, bringing in a bone-treating-bone Kidney function. We may choose to combine Heart Passing Points with 33.12 Heart Gate and 11.27 Five Tigers for a comprehensive rheumatoid arthritis treatment. When circulation is compromised, it is always helpful to clean DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas by cupping. Morning sickness and stabilizing pregnancy: 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points are the primary points used to treat morning sickness and threatened miscarriage; however, Heart Passing Points have similar indications. Due to the special relationship between the Stomach and Pericardium, these points stop vomiting and stabilize pregnancy. Note: PC6 Nei Guan stops vomiting because of this Yang Ming/Jue Yin connection, and also because it is directly related to the vagus nerve. Mental confusion: The Heart Passing Points treat phlegm masking the orifices, a common cause of mental confusion. In a class, Dr. Young once discussed a case in which Heart Passing Points were used to treat a five-year-old girl who did not talk. Impotence: For men with cold feet and impotence (frequently seen together), these points are excellent, as they warm the yang. Moxa pots, moxa boxes or moxa heat packs applied to the Ming Men area and to REN4-REN8 are a very good addition. Edema: Lower leg edema, which can be bilateral or unilateral, relates to the Heart and is a good indicator for these points. If lower leg edema is chronic and/or occurs due to Kidney weakness in addition to Heart, add 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan). Facial swelling relates to Kidney, and abdominal swelling relates to Liver. See 77.18 Shen Guan for further information related to heart failure and edema. Other indications: The Heart Passing Points can be used for other issues, such as those related to Heart and Lung, including upper back and shoulder pain, skin rashes, and rhinitis. Clinically, for all of these conditions I always choose 88.17-88.19 Four Horses over the Heart Passing Points. However, if a patient is treated with 88.01-88.03 and their sinus condition improves, it is due to the relationship between Stomach, Spleen and Lung, which the Heart Passing Points also utilize. Similarly, 88.17-88.19 Four Horses are my first choice for skin rashes; however, if a patient is treated for a heart condition and their skin improves, it is because all itching comes from the Heart. Knee pain: Master Tung taught that points with “Fire” or “Heart” in their name always treat the knee. Heart Passing Points may treat Heart-related knee pain when they are used for circulatory or coronary conditions. However, Tung’s system has so many fabulous points for Heart-related knee pain, and 11.09 Heart Knee would be my preferred choice, especially when treating degenerative knee pain. 88.03 Passing Heaven: This point can be used without 88.01 and 88.02 for knee pain or upper back and shoulder pain.",
        "combinations": "Knee pain: Bilaterally needle 11.09 Heart Knee; 88.02 Passing Mountain and 88.03 Passing Heaven or 88.03 Passing Heaven, alone.

See 77.18 Shen Guan for further information related to heart failure and edema. Other indications: The Heart Passing Points can be used for other issues, such as those related to Heart and Lung, including upper back and shoulder pain, skin rashes, and rhinitis. Clinically, for all of these conditions I always choose 88.17-88.19 Four Horses over the Heart Passing Points. However, if a patient is treated with 88.01-88.03 and their sinus condition improves, it is due to the relationship between Stomach, Spleen and Lung, which the Heart Passing Points also utilize. Similarly, 88.17-88.19 Four Horses are my first choice for skin rashes; however, if a patient is treated for a heart condition and their skin improves, it is because all itching comes from the Heart. Knee pain: Master Tung taught that points with “Fire” or “Heart” in their name always treat the knee. Heart Passing Points may treat Heart-related knee pain when they are used for circulatory or coronary conditions. However, Tung’s system has so many fabulous points for Heart-related knee pain, and 11.09 Heart Knee would be my preferred choice, especially when treating degenerative knee pain. 88.03 Passing Heaven: This point can be used without 88.01 and 88.02 for knee pain or upper back and shoulder pain.",

Depth considerations: 88.01 Passing Gate (the point closest to the knee) is needled more shallowly than the other two points on most people’s thighs, as the flesh is less full. On thin, elderly legs, you will often contact the femur upon needling; go slowly and gently so as not to damage the periosteum, remembering that bone is very sensitive. Depth: 0.5-1.0 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: ST32 and blood vessels: ST32 Fu Tu is located between 88.01 and 88.02, and is lateral to these two points. In The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, ST32 is called the meeting point of blood vessels and luo meridians, indicating that this point strongly regulates blood vessels, which makes it very useful for cardiac patients (Dr. Carson, 1973; Dr. Young, 2008). Heart Reaction Area: All three points have the Reaction Area of the Heart and are used to tonify the Spleen and Stomach. The two upper points, 88.02 Passing Mountain and 88.03 Passing Heaven, are especially good for heart disease and circulation; the two lower points, 88.01 Passing Gate and 88.02 Passing Mountain, have a very powerful regulatory effect on the Stomach. These points tonify fire to generate earth, and thereby regulate qi, blood and circulation. Stomach and Pericardium: Due to the special relationship between the Foot Yang Ming (ST) and Hand Jue Yin (PC), these points are used to strengthen the heart, blood, blood vessels and circulation, and they also have indications related to the stomach. “Passing Gate” indicates a relationship to PC6 Nei Guan (Dr. Young, 2008). These points pass through the Inner Gate to the Heart. Heart (fire), Liver (wood), Spleen (earth) and Kidney (water) all relate to blood; this explains the indications of heart disease, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, gastritis and weakness. Leg pain and weakness: I find these points to be extraordinary in the treatment of elderly patients with coronary heart disease and seriously compromised circulation resulting in extreme weakness, cold, pain or numbness in the lower body. I treated an 88-year-old woman who was unable to walk across her kitchen without extreme pain in both legs. Her feet were nearly black with small veins (larger than spider veins). Within two treatments her pain was reduced by eighty percent. She now walks to the mailbox to get her mail and rides her stationary bike 20 minutes every day. Her treatments not only benefited her, but also enabled her to care for her husband with late stage Parkinson’s, allowing them both to remain in their home. Note: Dr. Lee once said, “Lack of strength in the arms and legs is due to heart weakness. This may be, in turn, due to excessive cold or overdosing with heart disease medication”. Rheumatoid arthritis: These are the primary constitutional points used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. If the patient has one or two painful joints in the extremities, we can choose from many points to treat each joint directly. However, if all the joints hurt or the whole body aches, it is a circulation issue, with qi and blood stagnation due to deficiency or phlegm. Found between the Stomach and Spleen channels, the Heart Passing Points have a strong effect on phlegm in the body (phlegm in the joints, phlegm obstructing the brain). The Heart Passing Points are more beneficial than points related to bone, though frequently we touch the femur when needling these , bringing in a bone-treating-bone Kidney function. We may choose to combine Heart Passing Points with 33.12 Heart Gate and 11.27 Five Tigers for a comprehensive rheumatoid arthritis treatment. When circulation is compromised, it is always helpful to clean DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas by cupping. Morning sickness and stabilizing pregnancy: 88.09-88.11 Kidney Passing Points are the primary points used to treat morning sickness and threatened miscarriage; however, Heart Passing Points have similar indications. Due to the special relationship between the Stomach and Pericardium, these points stop vomiting and stabilize pregnancy. Note: PC6 Nei Guan stops vomiting because of this Yang Ming/Jue Yin connection, and also because it is directly related to the vagus nerve. Mental confusion: The Heart Passing Points treat phlegm masking the orifices, a common cause of mental confusion. In a class, Dr. Young once discussed a case in which Heart Passing Points were used to treat a five-year-old girl who did not talk. Impotence: For men with cold feet and impotence (frequently seen together), these points are excellent, as they warm the yang. Moxa pots, moxa boxes or moxa heat packs applied to the Ming Men area and to REN4-REN8 are a very good addition. Edema: Lower leg edema, which can be bilateral or unilateral, relates to the Heart and is a good indicator for these points. If lower leg edema is chronic and/or occurs due to Kidney weakness in addition to Heart, add 77.18 Kidney Gate (Shen Guan). Facial swelling relates to Kidney, and abdominal swelling relates to Liver. See 77.18 Shen Guan for further information related to heart failure and edema. Other indications: The Heart Passing Points can be used for other issues, such as those related to Heart and Lung, including upper back and shoulder pain, skin rashes, and rhinitis. Clinically, for all of these conditions I always choose 88.17-88.19 Four Horses over the Heart Passing Points.

Knee pain: Master Tung taught that points with “Fire” or “Heart” in their name always treat the knee. Heart Passing Points may treat Heart-related knee pain when they are used for circulatory or coronary conditions. However, Tung’s system has so many fabulous points for Heart-related knee pain, and 11.09 Heart Knee would be my preferred choice, especially when treating degenerative knee pain. 88.03 Passing Heaven: This point can be used without 88.01 and 88.02 for knee pain or upper back and shoulder pain.",

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 2.5 cun bilaterally. | Johnson: Needle bilaterally. Dao Ma: The points 88.04-88.06 are needled together in a combination known as Three Sisters. Note for male practitioners: For the patient’s privacy and convenience, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points may be used without Three Sisters for hormonal imbalances. Depth: 1.0-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Because 88.04-88.06 Three Sisters have the Reaction Area of the Kidney and Uterus, and because they are located on the Spleen meridian, these points strengthen the Kidney and control the blood, making them invaluable in the treatment of gynecological diseases. Three Plum Blossom: Not included in Tung’s system is a three-point pattern called Three Plum Blossom, located on the lower abdomen. (Note: A comprehensive write-up on Three Plum Blossom is found directly after Three Sisters) Three Plum Blossom points are nearly interchangeable with Three Sisters in their function, though Three Sisters points have a greater effect on the ovaries, while Three Plum Blossom points have a stronger effect on the uterus. I assigned the Reaction Areas of Kidney and Uterus to Three Plum Blossom as they incorporate 363 Lower Leg Points REN4 Guan Yuan (intersection of the Three Foot Yin channels and REN; benefits uterus and nourishes Kidney) and ST27 Da Ju (benefits Kidney and nourishes essence). Any female complaint that is cyclic in nature is considered hormonal and can be treated using 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points and either Three Sisters or Three Plum Blossom. Both of the latter can be needled for Liver qi congestion or gynecological issues that have an emotional component; both of them regulate the menstrual cycle and are used for irregular or delayed menses, infertility, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and to expel a dead fetus. Delayed menses: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters are my points of choice for irregular menses or when a menstrual cycle is delayed. When a woman is premenstrual and overdue (but not pregnant), and has irritability and breast pain, Three Sisters usually brings on the menstrual period within 24 to 48 hours. Birth control pills and regulating gynecological hormones: I use Three Sisters frequently to regulate hormones, especially in cases of PMS, irregular cycles or when a woman has been using birth control for an extended period of time. Three Sisters with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points are very helpful in these situations. If the patient is anovulatory, this treatment will encourage the return of hormonal cycling. This was perfectly illustrated in the case of a 27-year-old woman who had been using birth control pills for fifteen years. It took almost six months using acupuncture and herbs to regulate her menstrual cycles. This regulation is usually accomplished in less than three months when the use of birth control pills has been fewer than five years. In my opinion, it may be safe to use birth control pills for fewer than five years, but when they are taken longer, it can be difficult to return the body to normal hormonal activity. Menopause and regulating hormones: If a woman is premenopausal and wishes to extend her fertility, the above treatment will accomplish just that, in most cases. If a woman is exiting fertility and has hot flashes and night sweats, I balance hormones with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points and tonify the Kidneys with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, and avoid Three Sisters. If a woman is exiting fertility gracefully, without symptoms of hormone imbalance or Kidney deficiency, I leave well enough alone and do not encourage hormonal activity by needling any of these female reproductive points, though Three Emperors may still be applied. Amenorrhea: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters can be used in cases of amenorrhea; with a good herbal formula directed toward tonifying qi and blood (Liver and Spleen) and moving stagnation, the patient’s period should arrive. Return to the Nest and Gynecological Points alone are capable of this, but the addition of Three Sisters is likely to handle the situation. Dr. Young offers the following treatment for more difficult cases: Bilaterally needle 66.15 Water Fairy, ST25 Tian Shu; needle REN24 Cheng Jiang. The explanation for these points is as follows: Water Fairy is located near KD5 Shui Quan, the Xi-Cleft point on the Kidney meridian, and it tonifies Kidney Source qi. ST25 is the Mu Point for the Large Intestine and regulates qi and blood. REN24 is the best point for amenorrhea because the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians both go around the mouth. REN24 is the Jing-Well point for the REN channel so it opens the orifices. The REN channel also goes through the genitals and regulates qi and blood.  Fibroids and tumors: Dark blood vessels in the lower area of the thenar eminence (close to the wrist) are diagnostic of uterine fibroids or tumors. Fibroids often cause frequent urination, heavy bleeding and lower back pain. Thirty to forty percent of women over age thirty have fibroids, and many of them do not even know it. If the fibroids are the size of an egg, even if there are multiple small ones, they can be treated. If the fibroid is the size of an orange or larger, treating it is a bit too much to promise, and the patient likely will require surgery. If you can see the fibroids because they are that large, the patient will need surgery. If you can manage the symptoms related to fibroids (especially the heavy bleeding) until the patient reaches menopause, the fibroids will shrink at that time and she can probably avoid a hysterectomy. When a woman is told she has a tilted uterus, it is usually due to fibroids; the uterus does not tilt without a reason. During pregnancy: It is not uncommon for a woman to grow a fibroid during a pregnancy. The fibroid will disappear when the hormones change after delivery. Complications may arise if the fibroid prevents the baby from turning, causing a breech presentation. Even still, vaginal delivery may be possible with a skilled midwife or OB/GYN. In my practice, I always take the woman’s blood pressure regularly and palpate the position of the fetus so that I can easily determine if the pregnancy is not progressing as expected. By her second trimester, any pregnant woman in my practice also has regular prenatal visits with her primary birth practitioner; however, these days with the advent of HMOs and 15-minute appointments, patients cannot count on regular blood work or even blood pressure monitoring. I always order blood glucose, hematocrit and hemoglobin tests, as well, when these services are not rendered regularly. Three Sisters and Three Plum Blossom: I usually alternate these two point patterns when treating fibroids. Many women have multiple fibroids that swell right before their period, causing lower abdominal bloating and discomfort. We can use Three Sisters during the premenstrual week, as Three Plum Blossom (located on the lower abdomen) may be too sensitive. Please see Three Plum Blossom for point location and further information. Case history (myoma causing avalanche bleeding): A 35-year-old patient had an intrauterine myoma (in the wall of her uterus) very near the opening of the cervix, which prevented the cervix from closing completely. This caused her to spot or bleed continuously, and at times dangerously. She was capable of passing four clots, each the size of a fist, within fifteen minutes. Because of her age, this woman did not want to have a hysterectomy, though it had been recommended to her. In addition to Three Sisters, 11.06 Return to the Nest, and 11.24 Gynecological Points, she also required a loose herb formula and lots of moxa. Eventually, she was prescribed birth control pills. Almost twenty years later, she is now post- menopausal and still has her uterus. Case history (fibroids): I treated a 52-year-old woman with seven fibroids that varied in size; the largest was about the size of a duck egg. Every two weeks, she experienced avalanche bleeding. Her blood loss had led to extreme weakness and caused most of her hair to fall out. She was menopausal, with hot flashes and night sweats that were incapacitating. Because she was a prominent figure in our community, it was not convenient for her to have a hysterectomy, though her medical advisors were strongly recommending it. Using the above treatments along with a Chinese herbal formula and frequent application of moxa on LV1/ 365 Thigh Points SP1, we were able to get the bleeding completely under control. She kept her uterus and continued her rigorous speaking schedule. Her hair grew back, her health returned and she is now five years post-menopause. If a woman is close enough to menopause and has excessive or avalanche bleeding, usually the uterus can be saved. The fibroids will shrink after menopause. Case history (ten-pound fibroid): I walked into my treatment room and found a 40-year-old new patient lying face up on the table with what appeared to be a pregnancy but was a ten-pound fibroid. She had lost most of her hair and was dizzy and exhausted all of the time. With extremely heavy periods, she regularly bled onto her clothing and bed sheets. She was terrified to consult a surgeon for fear of requiring a hysterectomy. I knew that there was no possibility of resolving such a large fibroid. I promised to personally see her through her ordeal, and convinced her to allow me to take her to a renowned OB/GYN. Upon getting her blood test results, I asked her doctor whether he had ever seen hematocrit and hemoglobin levels that low, and his response was, “Not consistent with life.” He sent us immediately to the hospital for a blood transfusion of two pints. Shortly thereafter, the patient had a partial hysterectomy. Her dizziness stopped, her energy was restored, and within three months she had a full head of hair. Sometimes, the practitioner’s job is simply to help the patient do what needs to be done. LV1/SP1 moxa to stop bleeding: Because the Liver stores the blood and the Spleen controls the blood, moxa on LV1 and SP1 can be used for both avalanche bleeding (heat excess) and spotting (deficiency). A moxa stick or stick-on moxa may be chosen for the job. In my clinic, I use stick moxa. It is essential that the points are thoroughly heated without causing a burn or blister, as this would be painful and make it difficult to wear shoes. I never touch the tip of the moxa stick to the patient’s skin, because this certainly would cause a blister. Firmly holding the toe prevents the patient from flinching or jerking into the hot coal. I try to anticipate the patient’s indication that the point has become “hot.” After the heat from the tip of the moxa stick has effectively warmed the point to tolerance, I firmly grasp the large toe in a way that allows me to push the heat into the points with my thumb and index finger. I alternate between textbook LV1 and SP1, pushing the heat into one point while applying heat to the other. Count the seconds (“one, one thousand, two, one thousand,” etc.) while applying the heat to each point; it may initially take up to ten seconds for the patient to feel the heat, but after five applications, this may take only two seconds. Once both points have been heated completely (to the count of “one, one thousand”) on one foot, switch to the other foot. The patient is likely to require daily application, but it is extremely difficult if not impossible to apply moxa to these points on oneself, and LV1/SP1 moxa can be time consuming and smoky. For these reasons, I usually teach someone in the patient’s family how to use stick-on moxa. I advise them to be sure to use a shield between the large toe and second toe; a business card is perfect for this purpose. Fibroid formulas: To determine the correct herbal formula, you must first differentiate between excess and deficiency. If the Spleen qi is deficient, it will not be able to hold the blood, and blood will leak out. If there is blood heat (excess condition), the blood is being pushed out. Fibroids cause blockage, with heavy or excessive bleeding; vitalize the blood to stop bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, it must be stopped directly. Of course, every patient must be handled individually, but there are three primary ways to stop bleeding: 1. Block the source (flooding): Ten Ashes Formula (Shi Hui San) or Four Fresh Herbs (Si Sheng Wan) may be used to control heavy bleeding. 2. Disperse stagnation (uterine tumor): To the formula Gui Zhi Fu Ling (Cinnamon and Poria Formula), add Xiang Fu, Zhi Bei Mu, Mu Li (raw), and Xuan Shen. Gui Zhi guides the qi downward in this Urinary Bladder channel formula. 3. Tonify the Kidney and stop bleeding: Use Jiao Ai Tong. Note: Dang Gui Shao Yao Tang also can be used to move the blood, while powders or raw herbs can stop bleeding. I am aware of practitioners who have used Xue Yu Tan (carbonized hair) for these kinds of problems and seriously injured the patient. Please do not use this herb for functional uterine bleeding, as it clogs the system. Many other herbs are used in charred form to stop bleeding. Infertility due to hormonal imbalance: Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler is a great book about ovulation, fertility and female reproduction in general. If women are uninformed, I usually recommend that they read this book. Women who are receiving IVF treatments are usually very informed and have various devices for measuring their hormonal activity. Fertility Lens: I always suggest that a woman dealing with infertility acquire what is called a Fertility Lens. This device, also known as a female ovulation microscope, measures fertility through assessment of saliva. It is a small lipstick-shaped device with a built-in light source and a glass slide on which a small amount of saliva is placed. Once dried, saliva with a ferning pattern indicates ovulation, whereas outside of the 48- to 72-hour fertility window, there will be no visible striations. This device is extraordinarily helpful when a woman is attempting to conceive. Also, it is my opinion that every fifth-grade sex education class should include learning about the Fertility Lens, so that girls and women can know the wisdom of their bodies from an early age and avoid unwanted pregnancies. Treating infertility: 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points and Three Sisters are the Tung’s points that are chosen most frequently to treat infertility. They assist with any kind of delayed period, except in the case of pregnancy. Points that are chosen to treat infertility are always safe to needle during pregnancy; this is good to remember, as you won’t always know when a patient has conceived. Most infertility is considered to have hormonal causes. Though treatments may vary depending upon the cause, the points listed above are always utilized, even in non-hormonal cases such as a blocked fallopian tube. Other causes might be: Kidney and Liver deficiency, qi and blood deficiency, Chong and REN deficiency, or a combination of these, any of which could result in a malformed uterus, an unstable pregnancy or a nonviable fetus. When treating a woman for infertility, I ask her to avoid conception for three months while I sort out the problem. Infertility due to deficiency or cold accumulation: Many women experience an irregular menstrual cycle due to exhaustion, overwork and cold damp accumulation in the uterus. A tongue with a white coating or a pale tongue with teeth marks indicates damp cold, requiring qi tonification, warming, and Thigh Points clearing dampness with an herbal formula. In addition to needling the points found above, moxa on the following points is very useful: ST36, SP6, UB23, DU4, REN4-REN8. Infertility due to damp heat accumulation or stagnation: When a woman has heat stagnation in her uterus, her tongue is red with a greasy coating; when the tongue is dark purple, it is quite severe. A thick yellow coating is also indicative of damp heat accumulation. Though the herbal treatment is different than it would be for a deficient cold picture, the Tung’s acupuncture treatment is the same. However, I may initially use Three Plum Blossom more than Three Sisters in order to clear uterine stagnation and clean the womb. Bleeding small veins found in the area of SP6 San Yin Jiao is also useful for clearing uterine stagnation. In my clinic, every woman I have treated for infertility due to damp heat has immediately conceived after three months of cleaning and revitalizing (while preventing conception). Once conception is attempted, I am very careful not to needle Three Plum Blossom post-ovulation, in the event that the woman has conceived. However, it is ideal to encourage a calm “Sea of Life” (womb) even as the woman is moving into ovulation, to facilitate implantation. Blocked fallopian tube: Phlegm can cause fallopian tubes to stick together; however, inflammation of the cervix and fallopian tubes is seen more frequently and is often due to Liver qi and blood stagnation. To treat this kind of inflammation, you will need to soothe the Liver, regulate the qi, activate the blood and release the stagnation. Open Tube Formula (Tong Guan Tong): 3 Tao Ren, 3 Hong Hua, 3 Chuan Xiong, 3 Dang Gui (this part is Si Wu Tang); add 2 Hui Xiang, 3 Lian Qiao, 3 Xiang Fu, 3 Chi Shao, 3 Dan Shen, 1.5 Zhi Gan Cao.36 Good for many types of infertility, this formula moves the blood and disperses phlegm, with Xiang Fu regulating the qi. If you are not sure if the fallopian tube is blocked, use this formula for three to four weeks and then proceed to the next formula for male or female infertility. I tend to mix the herbs in a granulated format for delivery, as it is easier for those who require long-term treatment. Male or female infertility formulas, tonifying Liver and Kidney: I have had outstanding results with the following formulas. Consider one or the other (but not both): 1. You Gui Wan with Yu Lin Zhu. 2. 6-2-5 (works for males or females): 6 = Nourish Essence Formula (Liu Wei Di Huang); 2 = Two Immortals Formula (Er Xian Tang); 5 = Five Seeds (Wu Zi Yen Zhong Tang: Tu Si Zi, Fu Pen Zi, Che Qian Zi, Wu Wei Zi, Gou Qi Zi). Cupping: I do not cup the patient’s lower back if she is trying to conceive or during her first trimester, in order to keep a very calm Sea of Life in the lower jiao for implantation. When the lower back is cupped, the patient can feel a pulling in the front. After the second trimester (for a complicated pregnancy) or the first trimester (for a normal pregnancy), gentle cupping may be very 36 Amounts indicated are for loose herbs measured in qian (1 qian = 3 grams).  Amounts indicated are for loose herbs measured in qian (1 qian = 3 grams).  helpful. In a normal pregnancy, I always cup the lower back and sacral area two weeks before delivery. This is a good treatment to prepare the mother for labor and may make delivery slightly easier, should it involve “back labor” (when the descending baby digs their heels into the lumbar vertebrae or sacrum). Threatened miscarriage: If a patient habitually miscarries just after her period was due, her body is rejecting the sperm and needs tonification. Usually, habitual miscarriage occurs at the same point in the woman’s cycle each time, such as two weeks after conception. Patients who are receiving fertility treatment or are at risk of miscarriage need to avoid climbing stairs, bouncing (e.g., aerobics), excessive exercise, and overwork. Before ovulation, they should avoid any activities that might “stir the pot” – such as intercourse – to allow the Sea of Life to settle into a calm, quiet pond. If a patient is trying to conceive, do not needle Three Plum Blossom after ovulation. Stabilizing the pregnancy: Unilaterally needle 11.06 Return to the Nest on one hand, 11.24 Gynecological Points on the other hand. Then bilaterally needle 88.10 Passing Stomach, 88.11 Passing Back without strong stimulation. If you are treating the patient multiple times each week, needle only one point on each leg. Post-miscarriage treatment: If a patient has miscarried, I may ask her to resist the inclination to try to get pregnant immediately. This provides us time over the next few months to clean the womb, tonify the qi and blood, strengthen and astringe, so that her body is prepared to hold her next pregnancy. Some women who have miscarried are so traumatized that they fear bonding with their baby when they conceive again; however, it is vitally important that the mother bond immediately with her fetus so that it feels wanted, safe and secure. The mother needs to eat right, stop jogging, talk to her baby and avoid pretending she is not pregnant. Her practitioner must be very compassionate and sensitive to the losses she has already endured, and at the same time help her to embrace her new baby.",

Note for male practitioners: For the patient’s privacy and convenience, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points may be used without Three Sisters for hormonal imbalances. Depth: 1.0-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Because 88.04-88.06 Three Sisters have the Reaction Area of the Kidney and Uterus, and because they are located on the Spleen meridian, these points strengthen the Kidney and control the blood, making them invaluable in the treatment of gynecological diseases. Three Plum Blossom: Not included in Tung’s system is a three-point pattern called Three Plum Blossom, located on the lower abdomen. (Note: A comprehensive write-up on Three Plum Blossom is found directly after Three Sisters in this book.) Three Plum Blossom points are nearly interchangeable with Three Sisters in their function, though Three Sisters points have a greater effect on the ovaries, while Three Plum Blossom points have a stronger effect on the uterus. I assigned the Reaction Areas of Kidney and Uterus to Three Plum Blossom as they incorporate 363 Lower Leg Points REN4 Guan Yuan (intersection of the Three Foot Yin channels and REN; benefits uterus and nourishes Kidney) and ST27 Da Ju (benefits Kidney and nourishes essence). Any female complaint that is cyclic in nature is considered hormonal and can be treated using 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points and either Three Sisters or Three Plum Blossom. Both of the latter can be needled for Liver qi congestion or gynecological issues that have an emotional component; both of them regulate the menstrual cycle and are used for irregular or delayed menses, infertility, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and to expel a dead fetus. Delayed menses: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters are my points of choice for irregular menses or when a menstrual cycle is delayed. When a woman is premenstrual and overdue (but not pregnant), and has irritability and breast pain, Three Sisters usually brings on the menstrual period within 24 to 48 hours. Birth control pills and regulating gynecological hormones: I use Three Sisters frequently to regulate hormones, especially in cases of PMS, irregular cycles or when a woman has been using birth control for an extended period of time. Three Sisters with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points are very helpful in these situations. If the patient is anovulatory, this treatment will encourage the return of hormonal cycling. This was perfectly illustrated in the case of a 27-year-old woman who had been using birth control pills for fifteen years. It took almost six months using acupuncture and herbs to regulate her menstrual cycles. This regulation is usually accomplished in less than three months when the use of birth control pills has been fewer than five years. In my opinion, it may be safe to use birth control pills for fewer than five years, but when they are taken longer, it can be difficult to return the body to normal hormonal activity. Menopause and regulating hormones: If a woman is premenopausal and wishes to extend her fertility, the above treatment will accomplish just that, in most cases. If a woman is exiting fertility and has hot flashes and night sweats, I balance hormones with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points and tonify the Kidneys with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, and avoid Three Sisters. If a woman is exiting fertility gracefully, without symptoms of hormone imbalance or Kidney deficiency, I leave well enough alone and do not encourage hormonal activity by needling any of these female reproductive points, though Three Emperors may still be applied. Amenorrhea: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters can be used in cases of amenorrhea; with a good herbal formula directed toward tonifying qi and blood (Liver and Spleen) and moving stagnation, the patient’s period should arrive. Return to the Nest and Gynecological Points alone are capable of this, but the addition of Three Sisters is likely to handle the situation. Dr. Young offers the following treatment for more difficult cases: Bilaterally needle 66.15 Water Fairy, ST25 Tian Shu; needle REN24 Cheng Jiang. The explanation for these points is as follows: Water Fairy is located near KD5 Shui Quan, the Xi-Cleft point on the Kidney meridian, and it tonifies Kidney Source qi. ST25 is the Mu Point for the Large Intestine and regulates qi and blood. REN24 is the best point for amenorrhea because the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians both go around the mouth. REN24 is the Jing-Well point for the REN channel so it opens the orifices. The REN channel also goes through the genitals and regulates qi and blood.  Fibroids and tumors: Dark blood vessels in the lower area of the thenar eminence (close to the wrist) are diagnostic of uterine fibroids or tumors. Fibroids often cause frequent urination, heavy bleeding and lower back pain. Thirty to forty percent of women over age thirty have fibroids, and many of them do not even know it. If the fibroids are the size of an egg, even if there are multiple small ones, they can be treated. If the fibroid is the size of an orange or larger, treating it is a bit too much to promise, and the patient likely will require surgery. If you can see the fibroids because they are that large, the patient will need surgery. If you can manage the symptoms related to fibroids (especially the heavy bleeding) until the patient reaches menopause, the fibroids will shrink at that time and she can probably avoid a hysterectomy. When a woman is told she has a tilted uterus, it is usually due to fibroids; the uterus does not tilt without a reason. During pregnancy: It is not uncommon for a woman to grow a fibroid during a pregnancy. The fibroid will disappear when the hormones change after delivery. Complications may arise if the fibroid prevents the baby from turning, causing a breech presentation. Even still, vaginal delivery may be possible with a skilled midwife or OB/GYN. In my practice, I always take the woman’s blood pressure regularly and palpate the position of the fetus so that I can easily determine if the pregnancy is not progressing as expected. By her second trimester, any pregnant woman in my practice also has regular prenatal visits with her primary birth practitioner; however, these days with the advent of HMOs and 15-minute appointments, patients cannot count on regular blood work or even blood pressure monitoring. I always order blood glucose, hematocrit and hemoglobin tests, as well, when these services are not rendered regularly. Three Sisters and Three Plum Blossom: I usually alternate these two point patterns when treating fibroids. Many women have multiple fibroids that swell right before their period, causing lower abdominal bloating and discomfort. We can use Three Sisters during the premenstrual week, as Three Plum Blossom (located on the lower abdomen) may be too sensitive. Please see Three Plum Blossom for point location and further information. Case history (myoma causing avalanche bleeding): A 35-year-old patient had an intrauterine myoma (in the wall of her uterus) very near the opening of the cervix, which prevented the cervix from closing completely. This caused her to spot or bleed continuously, and at times dangerously. She was capable of passing four clots, each the size of a fist, within fifteen minutes. Because of her age, this woman did not want to have a hysterectomy, though it had been recommended to her. In addition to Three Sisters, 11.06 Return to the Nest, and 11.24 Gynecological Points, she also required a loose herb formula and lots of moxa. Eventually, she was prescribed birth control pills. Almost twenty years later, she is now post- menopausal and still has her uterus. Case history (fibroids): I treated a 52-year-old woman with seven fibroids that varied in size; the largest was about the size of a duck egg. Every two weeks, she experienced avalanche bleeding. Her blood loss had led to extreme weakness and caused most of her hair to fall out. She was menopausal, with hot flashes and night sweats that were incapacitating. Because she was a prominent figure in our community, it was not convenient for her to have a hysterectomy, though her medical advisors were strongly recommending it. Using the above treatments along with a Chinese herbal formula and frequent application of moxa on LV1/ 365 Thigh Points SP1, we were able to get the bleeding completely under control. She kept her uterus and continued her rigorous speaking schedule. Her hair grew back, her health returned and she is now five years post-menopause. If a woman is close enough to menopause and has excessive or avalanche bleeding, usually the uterus can be saved. The fibroids will shrink after menopause. Case history (ten-pound fibroid): I walked into my treatment room and found a 40-year-old new patient lying face up on the table with what appeared to be a pregnancy but was a ten-pound fibroid. She had lost most of her hair and was dizzy and exhausted all of the time. With extremely heavy periods, she regularly bled onto her clothing and bed sheets. She was terrified to consult a surgeon for fear of requiring a hysterectomy. I knew that there was no possibility of resolving such a large fibroid. I promised to personally see her through her ordeal, and convinced her to allow me to take her to a renowned OB/GYN. Upon getting her blood test results, I asked her doctor whether he had ever seen hematocrit and hemoglobin levels that low, and his response was, “Not consistent with life.” He sent us immediately to the hospital for a blood transfusion of two pints. Shortly thereafter, the patient had a partial hysterectomy. Her dizziness stopped, her energy was restored, and within three months she had a full head of hair. Sometimes, the practitioner’s job is simply to help the patient do what needs to be done. LV1/SP1 moxa to stop bleeding: Because the Liver stores the blood and the Spleen controls the blood, moxa on LV1 and SP1 can be used for both avalanche bleeding (heat excess) and spotting (deficiency). A moxa stick or stick-on moxa may be chosen for the job. In my clinic, I use stick moxa. It is essential that the points are thoroughly heated without causing a burn or blister, as this would be painful and make it difficult to wear shoes. I never touch the tip of the moxa stick to the patient’s skin, because this certainly would cause a blister. Firmly holding the toe prevents the patient from flinching or jerking into the hot coal. I try to anticipate the patient’s indication that the point has become “hot.” After the heat from the tip of the moxa stick has effectively warmed the point to tolerance, I firmly grasp the large toe in a way that allows me to push the heat into the points with my thumb and index finger. I alternate between textbook LV1 and SP1, pushing the heat into one point while applying heat to the other. Count the seconds (“one, one thousand, two, one thousand,” etc.) while applying the heat to each point; it may initially take up to ten seconds for the patient to feel the heat, but after five applications, this may take only two seconds. Once both points have been heated completely (to the count of “one, one thousand”) on one foot, switch to the other foot. The patient is likely to require daily application, but it is extremely difficult if not impossible to apply moxa to these points on oneself, and LV1/SP1 moxa can be time consuming and smoky. For these reasons, I usually teach someone in the patient’s family how to use stick-on moxa. I advise them to be sure to use a shield between the large toe and second toe; a business card is perfect for this purpose. Fibroid formulas: To determine the correct herbal formula, you must first differentiate between excess and deficiency. If the Spleen qi is deficient, it will not be able to hold the blood, and blood will leak out. If there is blood heat (excess condition), the blood is being pushed out. Fibroids cause blockage, with heavy or excessive bleeding; vitalize the blood to stop bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, it must be stopped directly. Of course, every patient must be handled individually, but there are three primary ways to stop bleeding: 1. Block the source (flooding): Ten Ashes Formula (Shi Hui San) or Four Fresh Herbs (Si Sheng Wan) may be used to control heavy bleeding. 2. Disperse stagnation (uterine tumor): To the formula Gui Zhi Fu Ling (Cinnamon and Poria Formula), add Xiang Fu, Zhi Bei Mu, Mu Li (raw), and Xuan Shen. Gui Zhi guides the qi downward in this Urinary Bladder channel formula. 3. Tonify the Kidney and stop bleeding: Use Jiao Ai Tong. Note: Dang Gui Shao Yao Tang also can be used to move the blood, while powders or raw herbs can stop bleeding. I am aware of practitioners who have used Xue Yu Tan (carbonized hair) for these kinds of problems and seriously injured the patient. Please do not use this herb for functional uterine bleeding, as it clogs the system. Many other herbs are used in charred form to stop bleeding. Infertility due to hormonal imbalance: Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler is a great book about ovulation, fertility and female reproduction in general. If women are uninformed, I usually recommend that they read this book. Women who are receiving IVF treatments are usually very informed and have various devices for measuring their hormonal activity. Fertility Lens: I always suggest that a woman dealing with infertility acquire what is called a Fertility Lens. This device, also known as a female ovulation microscope, measures fertility through assessment of saliva. It is a small lipstick-shaped device with a built-in light source and a glass slide on which a small amount of saliva is placed. Once dried, saliva with a ferning pattern indicates ovulation, whereas outside of the 48- to 72-hour fertility window, there will be no visible striations. This device is extraordinarily helpful when a woman is attempting to conceive. Also, it is my opinion that every fifth-grade sex education class should include learning about the Fertility Lens, so that girls and women can know the wisdom of their bodies from an early age and avoid unwanted pregnancies.

A tongue with a white coating or a pale tongue with teeth marks indicates damp cold, requiring qi tonification, warming, and 367 Thigh Points clearing dampness with an herbal formula. In addition to needling the points found above, moxa on the following points is very useful: ST36, SP6, UB23, DU4, REN4-REN8.

A thick yellow coating is also indicative of damp heat accumulation. Though the herbal treatment is different than it would be for a deficient cold picture, the Tung’s acupuncture treatment is the same. However, I may initially use Three Plum Blossom more than Three Sisters in order to clear uterine stagnation and clean the womb. Bleeding small veins found in the area of SP6 San Yin Jiao is also useful for clearing uterine stagnation.

Open Tube Formula (Tong Guan Tong): 3 Tao Ren, 3 Hong Hua, 3 Chuan Xiong, 3 Dang Gui (this part is Si Wu Tang); add 2 Hui Xiang, 3 Lian Qiao, 3 Xiang Fu, 3 Chi Shao, 3 Dan Shen, 1.5 Zhi Gan Cao.36 Good for many types of infertility, this formula moves the blood and disperses phlegm, with Xiang Fu regulating the qi. If you are not sure if the fallopian tube is blocked, use this formula for three to four weeks and then proceed to the next formula for male or female infertility. I tend to mix the herbs in a granulated format for delivery, as it is easier for those who require long-term treatment. Male or female infertility formulas, tonifying Liver and Kidney: I have had outstanding results with the following formulas. Consider one or the other (but not both): 1. You Gui Wan with Yu Lin Zhu. 2. 6-2-5 (works for males or females): 6 = Nourish Essence Formula (Liu Wei Di Huang); 2 = Two Immortals Formula (Er Xian Tang); 5 = Five Seeds (Wu Zi Yen Zhong Tang: Tu Si Zi, Fu Pen Zi, Che Qian Zi, Wu Wei Zi, Gou Qi Zi).37 Cupping: I do not cup the patient’s lower back if she is trying to conceive or during her first trimester, in order to keep a very calm Sea of Life in the lower jiao for implantation.

In a normal pregnancy, I always cup the lower back and sacral area two weeks before delivery. This is a good treatment to prepare the mother for labor and may make delivery slightly easier, should it involve “back labor” (when the descending baby digs their heels into the lumbar vertebrae or sacrum).

Before ovulation, they should avoid any activities that might “stir the pot” – such as intercourse – to allow the Sea of Life to settle into a calm, quiet pond. If a patient is trying to conceive, do not needle Three Plum Blossom after ovulation. Stabilizing the pregnancy: Unilaterally needle 11.06 Return to the Nest on one hand, 11.24 Gynecological Points on the other hand.

Note for male practitioners: For the patient’s privacy and convenience, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points may be used without Three Sisters for hormonal imbalances. Depth: 1.0-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Because 88.04-88.06 Three Sisters have the Reaction Area of the Kidney and Uterus, and because they are located on the Spleen meridian, these points strengthen the Kidney and control the blood, making them invaluable in the treatment of gynecological diseases. Three Plum Blossom: Not included in Tung’s system is a three-point pattern called Three Plum Blossom, located on the lower abdomen. (Note: A comprehensive write-up on Three Plum Blossom is found directly after Three Sisters in this book.) Three Plum Blossom points are nearly interchangeable with Three Sisters in their function, though Three Sisters points have a greater effect on the ovaries, while Three Plum Blossom points have a stronger effect on the uterus. I assigned the Reaction Areas of Kidney and Uterus to Three Plum Blossom as they incorporate 363 Lower Leg Points REN4 Guan Yuan (intersection of the Three Foot Yin channels and REN; benefits uterus and nourishes Kidney) and ST27 Da Ju (benefits Kidney and nourishes essence). Any female complaint that is cyclic in nature is considered hormonal and can be treated using 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points and either Three Sisters or Three Plum Blossom. Both of the latter can be needled for Liver qi congestion or gynecological issues that have an emotional component; both of them regulate the menstrual cycle and are used for irregular or delayed menses, infertility, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and to expel a dead fetus. Delayed menses: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters are my points of choice for irregular menses or when a menstrual cycle is delayed. When a woman is premenstrual and overdue (but not pregnant), and has irritability and breast pain, Three Sisters usually brings on the menstrual period within 24 to 48 hours. Birth control pills and regulating gynecological hormones: I use Three Sisters frequently to regulate hormones, especially in cases of PMS, irregular cycles or when a woman has been using birth control for an extended period of time. Three Sisters with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points are very helpful in these situations. If the patient is anovulatory, this treatment will encourage the return of hormonal cycling. This was perfectly illustrated in the case of a 27-year-old woman who had been using birth control pills for fifteen years. It took almost six months using acupuncture and herbs to regulate her menstrual cycles. This regulation is usually accomplished in less than three months when the use of birth control pills has been fewer than five years. In my opinion, it may be safe to use birth control pills for fewer than five years, but when they are taken longer, it can be difficult to return the body to normal hormonal activity. Menopause and regulating hormones: If a woman is premenopausal and wishes to extend her fertility, the above treatment will accomplish just that, in most cases. If a woman is exiting fertility and has hot flashes and night sweats, I balance hormones with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points and tonify the Kidneys with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, and avoid Three Sisters. If a woman is exiting fertility gracefully, without symptoms of hormone imbalance or Kidney deficiency, I leave well enough alone and do not encourage hormonal activity by needling any of these female reproductive points, though Three Emperors may still be applied. Amenorrhea: Along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points, Three Sisters can be used in cases of amenorrhea; with a good herbal formula directed toward tonifying qi and blood (Liver and Spleen) and moving stagnation, the patient’s period should arrive. Return to the Nest and Gynecological Points alone are capable of this, but the addition of Three Sisters is likely to handle the situation. Dr. Young offers the following treatment for more difficult cases: Bilaterally needle 66.15 Water Fairy, ST25 Tian Shu; needle REN24 Cheng Jiang. The explanation for these points is as follows: Water Fairy is located near KD5 Shui Quan, the Xi-Cleft point on the Kidney meridian, and it tonifies Kidney Source qi. ST25 is the Mu Point for the Large Intestine and regulates qi and blood. REN24 is the best point for amenorrhea because the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians both go around the mouth. REN24 is the Jing-Well point for the REN channel so it opens the orifices. The REN channel also goes through the genitals and regulates qi and blood.  Fibroids and tumors: Dark blood vessels in the lower area of the thenar eminence (close to the wrist) are diagnostic of uterine fibroids or tumors. Fibroids often cause frequent urination, heavy bleeding and lower back pain. Thirty to forty percent of women over age thirty have fibroids, and many of them do not even know it. If the fibroids are the size of an egg, even if there are multiple small ones, they can be treated. If the fibroid is the size of an orange or larger, treating it is a bit too much to promise, and the patient likely will require surgery. If you can see the fibroids because they are that large, the patient will need surgery. If you can manage the symptoms related to fibroids (especially the heavy bleeding) until the patient reaches menopause, the fibroids will shrink at that time and she can probably avoid a hysterectomy. When a woman is told she has a tilted uterus, it is usually due to fibroids; the uterus does not tilt without a reason. During pregnancy: It is not uncommon for a woman to grow a fibroid during a pregnancy. The fibroid will disappear when the hormones change after delivery. Complications may arise if the fibroid prevents the baby from turning, causing a breech presentation. Even still, vaginal delivery may be possible with a skilled midwife or OB/GYN. In my practice, I always take the woman’s blood pressure regularly and palpate the position of the fetus so that I can easily determine if the pregnancy is not progressing as expected. By her second trimester, any pregnant woman in my practice also has regular prenatal visits with her primary birth practitioner; however, these days with the advent of HMOs and 15-minute appointments, patients cannot count on regular blood work or even blood pressure monitoring. I always order blood glucose, hematocrit and hemoglobin tests, as well, when these services are not rendered regularly. Three Sisters and Three Plum Blossom: I usually alternate these two point patterns when treating fibroids. Many women have multiple fibroids that swell right before their period, causing lower abdominal bloating and discomfort. We can use Three Sisters during the premenstrual week, as Three Plum Blossom (located on the lower abdomen) may be too sensitive. Please see Three Plum Blossom for point location and further information. Case history (myoma causing avalanche bleeding): A 35-year-old patient had an intrauterine myoma (in the wall of her uterus) very near the opening of the cervix, which prevented the cervix from closing completely. This caused her to spot or bleed continuously, and at times dangerously. She was capable of passing four clots, each the size of a fist, within fifteen minutes. Because of her age, this woman did not want to have a hysterectomy, though it had been recommended to her. In addition to Three Sisters, 11.06 Return to the Nest, and 11.24 Gynecological Points, she also required a loose herb formula and lots of moxa. Eventually, she was prescribed birth control pills. Almost twenty years later, she is now post- menopausal and still has her uterus. Case history (fibroids): I treated a 52-year-old woman with seven fibroids that varied in size; the largest was about the size of a duck egg. Every two weeks, she experienced avalanche bleeding. Her blood loss had led to extreme weakness and caused most of her hair to fall out. She was menopausal, with hot flashes and night sweats that were incapacitating. Because she was a prominent figure in our community, it was not convenient for her to have a hysterectomy, though her medical advisors were strongly recommending it. Using the above treatments along with a Chinese herbal formula and frequent application of moxa on LV1/ SP1, we were able to get the bleeding completely under control. She kept her uterus and continued her rigorous speaking schedule. Her hair grew back, her health returned and she is now five years post-menopause. If a woman is close enough to menopause and has excessive or avalanche bleeding, usually the uterus can be saved. The fibroids will shrink after menopause. Case history (ten-pound fibroid): I walked into my treatment room and found a 40-year-old new patient lying face up on the table with what appeared to be a pregnancy but was a ten-pound fibroid. She had lost most of her hair and was dizzy and exhausted all of the time. With extremely heavy periods, she regularly bled onto her clothing and bed sheets. She was terrified to consult a surgeon for fear of requiring a hysterectomy. I knew that there was no possibility of resolving such a large fibroid. I promised to personally see her through her ordeal, and convinced her to allow me to take her to a renowned OB/GYN. Upon getting her blood test results, I asked her doctor whether he had ever seen hematocrit and hemoglobin levels that low, and his response was, “Not consistent with life.” He sent us immediately to the hospital for a blood transfusion of two pints. Shortly thereafter, the patient had a partial hysterectomy. Her dizziness stopped, her energy was restored, and within three months she had a full head of hair. Sometimes, the practitioner’s job is simply to help the patient do what needs to be done. LV1/SP1 moxa to stop bleeding: Because the Liver stores the blood and the Spleen controls the blood, moxa on LV1 and SP1 can be used for both avalanche bleeding (heat excess) and spotting (deficiency). A moxa stick or stick-on moxa may be chosen for the job. In my clinic, I use stick moxa. It is essential that the points are thoroughly heated without causing a burn or blister, as this would be painful and make it difficult to wear shoes. I never touch the tip of the moxa stick to the patient’s skin, because this certainly would cause a blister. Firmly holding the toe prevents the patient from flinching or jerking into the hot coal. I try to anticipate the patient’s indication that the point has become “hot.” After the heat from the tip of the moxa stick has effectively warmed the point to tolerance, I firmly grasp the large toe in a way that allows me to push the heat into the points with my thumb and index finger. I alternate between textbook LV1 and SP1, pushing the heat into one point while applying heat to the other. Count the seconds (“one, one thousand, two, one thousand,” etc.) while applying the heat to each point; it may initially take up to ten seconds for the patient to feel the heat, but after five applications, this may take only two seconds. Once both points have been heated completely (to the count of “one, one thousand”) on one foot, switch to the other foot. The patient is likely to require daily application, but it is extremely difficult if not impossible to apply moxa to these points on oneself, and LV1/SP1 moxa can be time consuming and smoky. For these reasons, I usually teach someone in the patient’s family how to use stick-on moxa. I advise them to be sure to use a shield between the large toe and second toe; a business card is perfect for this purpose. Fibroid formulas: To determine the correct herbal formula, you must first differentiate between excess and deficiency. If the Spleen qi is deficient, it will not be able to hold the blood, and blood will leak out. If there is blood heat (excess condition), the blood is being pushed out. Fibroids cause blockage, with heavy or excessive bleeding; vitalize the blood to stop bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, it must be stopped directly. Of course, every patient must be handled individually, but there are three primary ways to stop bleeding: 1. Block the source (flooding): Ten Ashes Formula (Shi Hui San) or Four Fresh Herbs (Si Sheng Wan) may be used to control heavy bleeding. 2. Disperse stagnation (uterine tumor): To the formula Gui Zhi Fu Ling (Cinnamon and Poria Formula), add Xiang Fu, Zhi Bei Mu, Mu Li (raw), and Xuan Shen. Gui Zhi guides the qi downward in this Urinary Bladder channel formula. 3. Tonify the Kidney and stop bleeding: Use Jiao Ai Tong. Note: Dang Gui Shao Yao Tang also can be used to move the blood, while powders or raw herbs can stop bleeding. I am aware of practitioners who have used Xue Yu Tan (carbonized hair) for these kinds of problems and seriously injured the patient. Please do not use this herb for functional uterine bleeding, as it clogs the system. Many other herbs are used in charred form to stop bleeding. Infertility due to hormonal imbalance: Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler is a great book about ovulation, fertility and female reproduction in general. If women are uninformed, I usually recommend that they read this book. Women who are receiving IVF treatments are usually very informed and have various devices for measuring their hormonal activity. Fertility Lens: I always suggest that a woman dealing with infertility acquire what is called a Fertility Lens. This device, also known as a female ovulation microscope, measures fertility through assessment of saliva. It is a small lipstick-shaped device with a built-in light source and a glass slide on which a small amount of saliva is placed. Once dried, saliva with a ferning pattern indicates ovulation, whereas outside of the 48- to 72-hour fertility window, there will be no visible striations. This device is extraordinarily helpful when a woman is attempting to conceive. Also, it is my opinion that every fifth-grade sex education class should include learning about the Fertility Lens, so that girls and women can know the wisdom of their bodies from an early age and avoid unwanted pregnancies. Treating infertility: 11.06 Return to the Nest, 11.24 Gynecological Points and Three Sisters are the Tung’s points that are chosen most frequently to treat infertility. They assist with any kind of delayed period, except in the case of pregnancy. Points that are chosen to treat infertility are always safe to needle during pregnancy; this is good to remember, as you won’t always know when a patient has conceived. Most infertility is considered to have hormonal causes. Though treatments may vary depending upon the cause, the points listed above are always utilized, even in non-hormonal cases such as a blocked fallopian tube. Other causes might be: Kidney and Liver deficiency, qi and blood deficiency, Chong and REN deficiency, or a combination of these, any of which could result in a malformed uterus, an unstable pregnancy or a nonviable fetus. When treating a woman for infertility, I ask her to avoid conception for three months while I sort out the problem. Infertility due to deficiency or cold accumulation: Many women experience an irregular menstrual cycle due to exhaustion, overwork and cold damp accumulation in the uterus. A tongue with a white coating or a pale tongue with teeth marks indicates damp cold, requiring qi tonification, warming, and 367 Thigh Points clearing dampness with an herbal formula. In addition to needling the points found above, moxa on the following points is very useful: ST36, SP6, UB23, DU4, REN4-REN8. Infertility due to damp heat accumulation or stagnation: When a woman has heat stagnation in her uterus, her tongue is red with a greasy coating; when the tongue is dark purple, it is quite severe. A thick yellow coating is also indicative of damp heat accumulation. Though the herbal treatment is different than it would be for a deficient cold picture, the Tung’s acupuncture treatment is the same. However, I may initially use Three Plum Blossom more than Three Sisters in order to clear uterine stagnation and clean the womb. Bleeding small veins found in the area of SP6 San Yin Jiao is also useful for clearing uterine stagnation. In my clinic, every woman I have treated for infertility due to damp heat has immediately conceived after three months of cleaning and revitalizing (while preventing conception). Once conception is attempted, I am very careful not to needle Three Plum Blossom post-ovulation, in the event that the woman has conceived. However, it is ideal to encourage a calm “Sea of Life” (womb) even as the woman is moving into ovulation, to facilitate implantation. Blocked fallopian tube: Phlegm can cause fallopian tubes to stick together; however, inflammation of the cervix and fallopian tubes is seen more frequently and is often due to Liver qi and blood stagnation. To treat this kind of inflammation, you will need to soothe the Liver, regulate the qi, activate the blood and release the stagnation. Open Tube Formula (Tong Guan Tong): 3 Tao Ren, 3 Hong Hua, 3 Chuan Xiong, 3 Dang Gui (this part is Si Wu Tang); add 2 Hui Xiang, 3 Lian Qiao, 3 Xiang Fu, 3 Chi Shao, 3 Dan Shen, 1.5 Zhi Gan Cao.36 Good for many types of infertility, this formula moves the blood and disperses phlegm, with Xiang Fu regulating the qi. If you are not sure if the fallopian tube is blocked, use this formula for three to four weeks and then proceed to the next formula for male or female infertility. I tend to mix the herbs in a granulated format for delivery, as it is easier for those who require long-term treatment. Male or female infertility formulas, tonifying Liver and Kidney: I have had outstanding results with the following formulas. Consider one or the other (but not both): 1. You Gui Wan with Yu Lin Zhu. 2. 6-2-5 (works for males or females): 6 = Nourish Essence Formula (Liu Wei Di Huang); 2 = Two Immortals Formula (Er Xian Tang); 5 = Five Seeds (Wu Zi Yen Zhong Tang: Tu Si Zi, Fu Pen Zi, Che Qian Zi, Wu Wei Zi, Gou Qi Zi). Cupping: I do not cup the patient’s lower back if she is trying to conceive or during her first trimester, in order to keep a very calm Sea of Life in the lower jiao for implantation. When the lower back is cupped, the patient can feel a pulling in the front. After the second trimester (for a complicated pregnancy) or the first trimester (for a normal pregnancy), gentle cupping may be very 36 Amounts indicated are for loose herbs measured in qian (1 qian = 3 grams).  Amounts indicated are for loose herbs measured in qian (1 qian = 3 grams). helpful. In a normal pregnancy, I always cup the lower back and sacral area two weeks before delivery. This is a good treatment to prepare the mother for labor and may make delivery slightly easier, should it involve “back labor” (when the descending baby digs their heels into the lumbar vertebrae or sacrum). Threatened miscarriage: If a patient habitually miscarries just after her period was due, her body is rejecting the sperm and needs tonification. Usually, habitual miscarriage occurs at the same point in the woman’s cycle each time, such as two weeks after conception. Patients who are receiving fertility treatment or are at risk of miscarriage need to avoid climbing stairs, bouncing (e.g., aerobics), excessive exercise, and overwork. Before ovulation, they should avoid any activities that might “stir the pot” – such as intercourse – to allow the Sea of Life to settle into a calm, quiet pond. If a patient is trying to conceive, do not needle Three Plum Blossom after ovulation. Stabilizing the pregnancy: Unilaterally needle 11.06 Return to the Nest on one hand, 11.24 Gynecological Points on the other hand. Then bilaterally needle 88.10 Passing Stomach, 88.11 Passing Back without strong stimulation. If you are treating the patient multiple times each week, needle only one point on each leg. Post-miscarriage treatment: If a patient has miscarried, I may ask her to resist the inclination to try to get pregnant immediately. This provides us time over the next few months to clean the womb, tonify the qi and blood, strengthen and astringe, so that her body is prepared to hold her next pregnancy. Some women who have miscarried are so traumatized that they fear bonding with their baby when they conceive again; however, it is vitally important that the mother bond immediately with her fetus so that it feels wanted, safe and secure. The mother needs to eat right, stop jogging, talk to her baby and avoid pretending she is not pregnant. Her practitioner must be very compassionate and sensitive to the losses she has already endured, and at the same time help her to embrace her new baby.",

        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Passing Kidney, Passing Stomach, and Passing Back are needled together as a Dao Ma in the combination known as the Kidney Passing Points. They are very similar to 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, and are considered interchangeable. With the Reaction Area of the Kidney and their location along the Spleen channel, they tonify the earth to control water. Whereas Three Emperors have a more gynecological, sexual and neurological function, the Kidney Passing Points are primarily selected to treat edema, nephrology, and gestational conditions. Back pain and stabilization of pregnancy: The upper two Kidney Passing Points are used for back pain or to calm the fetus and reduce morning sickness. In the treatment of habitual miscarriage, less is more, so I may only needle one point on each leg, alternating 88.10 and 88.11, along with 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. Dietary advice to avoid morning sickness: The best treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is to radically increase the overall consumption of protein, in very small amounts. Within two weeks of adjusting the diet in this way, even the most severe case of hyperemesis should be largely resolved. I treated two vegetarian women for hyperemesis in pregnancy. One was also asthmatic; because of her poor health, she was frequently in the hospital. Because cooking smells are intolerable in cases like these, I recommended bacon cheeseburgers from a drive- through fast food restaurant. Both women showed up the next week with their hamburger wrappers, bragging that their nausea was completely gone. They were then able to prepare better quality proteins in their own kitchens. I guarantee this result; this dietary adjustment is better than any herbs or acupuncture treatments for morning sickness. Edema: REN9 Shui Fen is the main point for edema. If it is whole-body edema, we use the Kidney Passing Points. If the edema is only in one leg, it is likely to be caused by a heart issue, so we would needle 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points. Please see 77.18 Shen Guan for additional commentary. Cold feet: Dr. Lee recommended using these points to treat cold feet in men, and she had good results. I prefer 88.01-88.03 Heart Passing Points, with moxa on the kidneys, to strengthen the heart and increase blood circulation: “The most important indication for these points is not given in the original book. It is cold feet in men. This occurs mostly in men who are tall and thin. They suffer from insomnia and they speak without force. Generally they feel miserable. In Chinese there is a saying, ‘A man should not have cold feet.’ These cold feet are due to Kidney, Urinary Bladder, and urogenital weakness. Instead of Heart heat descending as it should to warm the lower body, it counter-flows upward causing insomnia and restlessness. Instead of Kidney water ascending to the head to cool the head and brain and thus making the mind calm and bright, it sinks downward to chill the feet. This means that yin and yang separate, and do not inter-promote. In a woman, this same scenario causes facial edema. Therefore, it is also said, ‘A man should not wear shoes and a woman should not wear a hat’. Wearing shoes refers to cold feet, while wearing a hat refers to facial edema” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Dry mouth and sore throat: All three Kidney Passing Points are used for dry mouth and sore throat. Four needles: Of the three points, 88.09 is chosen the least. I often bilaterally needle only 88.10-88.11, though I might needle all six points in the treatment of edema or peripheral numbness. Individual point indications: Stomach issues: 88.10 Passing Stomach can be needled on its own to treat stomach problems. Frozen shoulder, back pain: 88.11 Passing Back can be chosen to treat frozen shoulder, back pain, and upper back ache caused by kidney stones. (It stops the pain but does not dissolve the stone).",

This means that yin and yang separate, and do not inter-promote. In a woman, this same scenario causes facial edema. Therefore, it is also said, ‘A man should not wear shoes and a woman should not wear a hat’. Wearing shoes refers to cold feet, while wearing a hat refers to facial edema” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Dry mouth and sore throat: All three Kidney Passing Points are used for dry mouth and sore throat. Four needles: Of the three points, 88.09 is chosen the least. I often bilaterally needle only 88.10-88.11, though I might needle all six points in the treatment of edema or peripheral numbness. Individual point indications: Stomach issues: 88.10 Passing Stomach can be needled on its own to treat stomach problems. Frozen shoulder, back pain: 88.11 Passing Back can be chosen to treat frozen shoulder, back pain, and upper back ache caused by kidney stones. (It stops the pain but does not dissolve the stone).",

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 3 cun perpendicularly towards the femur. Superficial depth addresses KI, middle depth addresses the LR, and deep level needling addresses the HT. | Johnson: Dao Ma: 88.12 Bright Yellow (Chief Point), 88.13 Heaven Yellow, and 88.14 This Yellow are collectively known as Three Yellows, and are usually needled bilaterally, for a total of six needles. •  Palpation: Careful palpation of the Liver channel is essential to obtain the outstanding effects of these points. On any patient with severe liver disease, these points are excruciatingly painful to palpation, and they may be too sensitive to be needled during the first few treatments and/or premenstrually (use 11.20 Wood Inflammation). •  Needle bilaterally: After starting with a deep needle at the middle point, Bright Yellow, palpate softly for the proximal and distal points. Deep palpation would stimulate the needle at Bright Yellow, which could be uncomfortable for the patient.•  Needle depths: When using these points, deep needle insertion is essential and relates to the points’ Reaction Areas. A needle insertion of 1.0 cun is used for treatment at the Kidney level, 2.0 cun is good for Liver, and 3.0 cun also affects the Heart. Because blood diseases involve all three, I often use a 50mm needle insertion to connect them. If the patient is very thin or small, downsize to a 40mm needle, whereas a patient of average or larger size requires a 50mm or even 60mm needle. •  Needle gauge and bruising: When needling Three Yellows, place your consciousness in the tip of the needle so you can experience the resistance caused by larger blood vessels when it happens. A larger blood vessel feels like a smaller tendon in that it pushes back, in the same way a rubber band would if needled. Withdraw and slightly redirect the needle to move off of a blood vessel. I usually use a .20 x 50mm needle, which is the thinnest gauge available in 50mm needles (Japanese gauge 3, Chinese gauge 36). Some diseases are characterized by bruising, so go slowly and carefully to avoid unnecessary purpura. In a case of advanced cirrhosis, bruising is expected with these points; however, as the condition improves, the bruising will stop. •  Depth: 1.0-3.0 cun •  Kidney disease: 1.0 cun•  Liver disease: 2.0 cun•  Heart disease: 3.0 cun",
        "comments": "Three Yellows: Among all of Master Tung’s points, and among classic textbook points as well, none treat the liver in a more profound and lasting way than Three Yellows. They address liver organ disease and are not used to treat emotional issues due to Liver qi congestion. Though emotional issues are also likely to be present, liver disease trumps emotional states caused by Liver qi congestion, so we add 11.20 Wood Inflammation rather than 11.17 Wood (Anger), but never both, as that could make the patient feel ill. •  Energetic pathways: In TCM, we understand that the Spleen controls blood and the Liver restores blood. Three Yellows points are located on the Liver meridian, but because they are in close proximity to the Spleen channel, they regulate the functions of both the liver and spleen. This is one of my favorite point patterns to use in the treatment of blood diseases. Exhaustion due to liver: In the 1980s in San Francisco, I had an HIV/AIDS clinic where I treated a multitude of patients with hepatitis and liver disease. The effects of Three Yellows were outstanding. From treating these patients, I realized that exhaustion due to liver was entirely based upon the liver’s inability to clean the blood, and that any direct tonification of qi and blood would worsen the condition. With proper treatment, patients who previously had been carried into my office were able to climb the two flights of stairs to reach my clinic. Today, I use Three Yellows for any kind of exhaustion, even a headache, when it is caused by toxicity or Liver weakness. •  Hepatitis: Hepatitis A, B and C can be treated using the same basic protocol: Three Yellows, 11.20 Wood Inflammation, and a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. With hepatitis A and B, the herbal emphasis is on cleaning the blood. However, in the treatment of hepatitis C, the herbal prescription is radically different, utilizing the principles of tonifying Spleen qi, moistening Kidney yin, moving blood stagnation, and detoxifying the liver. •  Case history (hepatitis C with end-stage cirrhosis): For two years, three times weekly, I treated a 60-year-old female patient who had hepatitis C and end-stage cirrhosis. She presented with abdominal ascites, severe edema in the legs and feet, extremely itchy rashes, exhaustion, irritability, depression, insomnia and suicidal ideation. She tried to be cooperative but was unwilling to take any herbs. At that time, the hepatitis C drug Harvoni was being tested in trials but was unavailable to the general public. I cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, and a combination of Three Yellows/Three Emperors. We modified her diet to clear damp heat, avoid toxins and tonify the Spleen. At first, she had radical bruising along the Liver channel, as bleeding is a typical sign of end-stage cirrhosis. However, within three months, the bruising diminished and then stopped. Within a few weeks of her initial treatment, her itching subsided and the rashes cleared completely, though the water retention continued to be an intermittent concern that occasionally required the use of Lasix. Once Harvoni became available, she was cleared of hepatitis C, and the ascites receded. She is currently waiting for a liver transplant but is unlikely to receive it due to her age and condition. Given enough time, it is possible that this patient could have recovered completely; however, she was not cooperative enough to see it through, and she chose to abandon her dietary restrictions and regular treatments. •  Case history (hepatitis B): This patient was told he needed a liver transplant due to heroin abuse. Though he had been clean and sober for five years, he initially presented as jaundiced (green/gray/yellow) with nosebleeds, serious liver pain, back pain, exhaustion, headaches and insomnia. Because his Three Yellows points were extremely sensitive to palpation, he would not allow me to needle them for the first six weeks. I needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation with other, less sensitive points and prescribed a hepatitis B formula. I cupped the rib cage over the liver, being careful not to touch the swollen liver itself, and cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas on both sides. When his liver had recovered enough to tolerate my needling of Three Yellows, he would only allow it while holding on to my elbow so he could feel that he was in control. After six months of biweekly treatments, he was removed from the transplant list, and within a year he was in good health, riding his mountain bike all over town. He continued taking herbs for three years and remained healthy until he took a trip to Thailand and unfortunately relapsed into drug use. Case history (hepatitis in pregnancy): A 46-year-old presented with hepatitis B during pregnancy. She was exhausted, slightly jaundiced and afraid she might lose her baby. Because Three Yellows are extraordinary in treating exhaustion due to liver, and safe to needle during pregnancy, I needled them along with 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. I cupped her Toxin Areas and was able to give her a gentle liver cleansing formula, being very careful not to over-vitalize blood. After she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, we were able to use a stronger formula and permanently resolve her hepatitis B. She recently celebrated her 75th birthday and her daughter celebrated her 29th. •  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic predisposition for cysts in both the liver and kidneys. This kind of cyst formation ultimately leads to kidney failure, resulting in dialysis or a transplant. Early presentation may be as simple as slight lower back pain, slight hypertension, and nocturia. Patients with this disorder usually have a parent and/or sibling who are also dealing with it, and they should receive genetic counseling. Patients with PKD are usually monitored by their family physician or a nephrologist. It is essential that they eat a low-protein diet, as too much protein is extremely hard on the kidneys. •  Treatment: I have treated three cases of PKD using much the same approach. Because both the liver and kidneys are compromised, toxins may accumulate. Start with cleaning the toxins by: 1) cupping DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, 2) cupping over the ribs on top of the liver, and 3) very gently cupping the lower back over the kidneys, following the color. Combine 11.20 Wood Inflammation and Three Yellows with 77.18 Shen Guan, occasionally using all Three Emperors (77.18-77.21). A carefully constructed herbal formula is absolutely essential. If you are unable to create a formula of individual loose herbs, you must refer these patients to someone who can. •  Case history (PKD, early intervention and remission): My first patient with a diagnosis of PKD was a 50-year-old woman with two adult children. She presented with minor low back pain and moderately high blood pressure. After twelve months of daily loose herbs and biweekly acupuncture treatments, she was officially in remission, which is extremely rare with this condition. Her liver and kidney cysts disappeared, she was able to discontinue all blood pressure medications, and her blood pressure stayed low once it had been brought down. She no longer feared kidney failure. I had begun treatment as soon as her symptoms were recognized, which leads me to believe that early intervention is far more likely to be successful. •  Case history (PKD, moderately advanced): The second patient had moderately advanced PKD and a brain aneurism that required surgical repair. He had a very high-stress job, had three children and was undergoing a divorce. I was unsuccessful in lowering his blood pressure, the first obvious sign of PKD. His brain surgery interrupted our treatment during a critical time, and a few years later he required a kidney transplant. •  Case history (PKD, late intervention): The third patient was a 35-year-old woman whose mother had died at age 52 due to PKD, and whose older sister was already on dialysis. I urgently recommended that she begin treatment, explaining the difficulties of PKD and my one successful cure. Because her only symptom was a slightly elevated blood pressure, she chose alternatives of a spiritual nature, believing she could heal it on her own. Eighteen years later, she wound up in my office asking for help. At that time, the cysts had enlarged her kidneys by half their normal size. Her blood pressure required medications, she was tired, and her sleep patterns were erratic. I told her I was not sure if I could manage her case, but I would try. I gave her a powerful herbal formula for tonifying Liver and Kidneys while breaking cysts and vitalizing qi and blood. I modified the formula many times, and within eighteen months she was feeling better than she had in years, riding her bike, doing African dance, sleeping well, and working hard. Her kidneys had begun to shrink, though multiple cysts were still identified in both kidneys and the liver. We continued treatment two or three times weekly. I began to use granules instead of loose herbs, as she was planning a three-month trip to Europe. We had agreed to communicate over Skype at least every other week while she was away, but she discontinued communication with me once she arrived in Holland. Ten days before she was due to return to the United States, she called to tell me that she had seriously relapsed. When she returned, she told me that she had discontinued her herbs when she arrived in the Netherlands because she was convinced that she was healed, but in fact the herbs had been entirely supporting her. Ten weeks after she stopped taking the herbs, their effects completely wore off and she crashed. Though she was full of regret, we were unable to regain the lost ground. She recently had a kidney transplant, and her body is now attempting to regain balance and recognize itself under the influence of immunosuppressive drugs. Though she has regained some of her lost muscle mass and is feeling far better than she did just before the transplant, she feels a kind of internal shaking, is easily overwhelmed, and has very dark skin around her eyes. She continues to struggle with seriously heeding my warnings that she focus only on her health and discontinue any superfluous activity. She is overconfident and still unable to fully recognize how frail she is. She frequently overcommits herself and later regrets it. As much as I have come to love this patient and fight for her life, I cannot save her from herself. Her case is a mixed blessing and a good lesson to never take a winning streak for granted. It is my belief that we would have prevailed if her acupuncture and herbs had been uninterrupted. I think she could have avoided dialysis and therefore a transplant. Her kidneys never would have returned to normal, but the disease process would likely not have progressed, and she might have maintained her good health. •  Wind diseases: Wind diseases are characterized by their shifting nature. Three Yellows points are very useful in the treatment of wind diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Meniere’s, because they very powerfully expel wind while tonifying the Liver. Shaking diseases such as Parkinson’s always relate to both the Liver and Kidneys, so Three Yellows alone is not enough. In this disease, water is not nourishing wood, so the root (Kidney/water) also needs to be treated. Meniere’s disease involves the inner ear (the window to the Kidney); when treating Meniere’s we also need to consider both dizziness and vomiting (wind and phlegm). •  Dizziness and vertigo: There are numerous reasons for dizziness and vertigo. Careful differentiation is required because in some cases, there may be more than one causative factor. The three primary factors are: excess Liver wind (including internal wind with external wind), Kidney yin or yang deficiency (or both), and blood deficiency. •  Meniere’s treatment: Meniere’s disease will return, usually in the springtime, if you do not completely resolve it. Three Yellows points are the best choice for treating Meniere’s disease, as it is an exacerbation of internal wind meeting external wind. To bilateral Three Yellows, add either LI11 Qu Chi or 22.05 Ling Gu, and PC6 Nei Guan, needled unilaterally. It is important to minimize the number of needles when treating wind diseases. Alternatively, consider 88.17-88.19 Four Horses when treating internal ear diseases, such as Meniere’s or Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) is always a good option for wind diseases and internal ear pathologies, and it may be added to either Three Yellows or Four Horses, though its influence is already there. 44.07 Back Face (LI15) may be bled. •  LI11 Qu Chi is the He-Sea point on the Large Intestine channel and the primary TCM point for eliminating wind. It can be used for qi reversal and exterior conditions, and it cools heat, clears dampness, and regulates the blood, making it ideal in the treatment of all kinds of dizziness and vertigo. It utilizes a special internal relationship between the Yang Ming and Jue Yin channels (LI/LV), as well as the Yang Ming internal/external relationship with Stomach, giving it a strong qi and blood connection as well. 22.05 Ling Gu uses these same relationships and additionally tonifies the Kidney. Remember, choices need to be made to minimize the number of needles, so be selective rather than including all possible options (what I call “kitchen sinking”). •  PC6 Nei Guan is frequently used in this combination because it treats nausea and vomiting, which are common problems when vertigo is present. It additionally shares the Jue Yin connection to the Liver as well as a special internal connection to the Yang Ming (PC/ST). •  GB31 Wind Market mimics the effects of its counterpart, 88.12 Bright Yellow, and may also be added to Three Yellows, especially when it is used to treat blood diseases, particularly those involving the bone marrow and/or Liver wind. •  44.07 Back Face (LI15) is commonly bled for Meniere’s disease due to the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming and Foot Jue Yin (LI/LV) and also the internal/external Liver and Gallbladder connection. Back Face is also useful for tinnitus and sudden deafness, for the same reasons. This point raises the pure qi and is also used for exhaustion and vomiting, similar to 1010.07 All Pivot for heat stroke. •  Epley Maneuver: Do a Google search for instructional videos to learn how to apply the Epley Maneuver, which is used to dislodge crystals found in the semicircular ducts of the inner ear. Make sure that patients with Meniere’s disease have someone to drive them home after undergoing this procedure, as they may immediately experience severe vertigo and even vomiting, which will then resolve. •  Meniere’s formula: Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang and Er Chen Tang (Citrus and Pinellia Formula). Use Lychi and Chrysanthemum (Ji Gu Di Huang) to treat long term. •  Dizziness due to Kidney deficiency: Kidney deficiency is the most commonly seen cause of dizziness in the clinic; this can be either yin or yang deficiency, or both, and it most frequently affects the elderly. By far the best treatment in these cases is bilateral 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, because 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) is Master Tung’s master Kidney point. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added, or Shen Guan may be added to 88.12 and 88.14 Two Yellows to tonify water and eliminate wind while simultaneously building blood and minimizing the number of needles. 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai also can be used in these cases, as they are specific for dizziness and utilize the special internal relationship between the Shao Yang and Shao Yin (SJ/KD). •  Dizziness due to blood diseases: Three Yellows are my favorite points for treating blood diseases, although in Tung’s acupuncture we might also consider 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop. Choices are made relative to diagnosis and presentation. Of the three options, I have found Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to be the least effective, though I love these points for other uses. When treating Liver blood deficiency, I always choose Three Yellows because it tonifies and strengthens the Liver to clean the blood and expel wind. If the patient is also Spleen qi deficient, I might use Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment (bilateral ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7), with or without moxa on ST36 and SP6. Three Weights are chosen for blood diseases because they are located on the Gallbladder channel, adjacent to GB39 (the Sea of Marrow), and they affect both the Liver, which governs the blood, and the Spleen, which controls the blood. They disperse both wind and phlegm and are often used to increase circulation to the head and/or brain. Moxa on the Ming Men and REN4-REN8 is also very useful in building blood. •  Parkinson’s disease: There is still much to be learned to better understand Parkinson’s disease; however, the latest research implies that a buildup of endotoxins and environmental toxins (from heavy metals and other sources) in the brain causes a cascade of effects, including debilitating neurological deficits, dementia and depression. Functional medicine is on the brink of great discoveries with regard to detoxification protocols and immune system recovery through rebuilding the microbiome and restoring proper bile flow, thus reinstating detoxification pathways that have failed. Unfortunately, much irreversible damage has already been done, and it is predicted that in the relatively near future, 50% of all males will suffer from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Brain toxicity has now replaced amyloid plaque as the causative factor in Alzheimer’s. Major contributors are mercury (in fish and amalgams) and aluminum found in vaccines, which are often pushed upon unsuspecting populations around the world. Excessive amounts of lead, iron and copper are now frequently found in human bodies, as well as molds, parasites, viruses and retroviruses. Food and water sources are contaminated around the globe, and the desire to remain ignorant plagues any hope for a timely resolution. Also, overuse of antibiotics, NSAIDs and steroids have certainly played a part. That said, in the treatment of Parkinson’s, we can only do our best to protect any remaining neurons from further degeneration. •  Parkinson’s in TCM: In TCM, Parkinson’s is viewed as a shaking disease due to phlegm, fire, and wind. Because it is nearly always found in patients over the age of sixty, we want to avoid overtreatment and over-sedation by streamlining our protocols, using the fewest number of needles to achieve the best results. Cleaning toxins from the body (blood and brain) is paramount. I believe that in the near future, this will best be accomplished via intravenous delivery of agents that restore bile flow, stabilize mast cells and upregulate Nrf2. Substances such as phosphatidylcholine, glutathione, quercetin, r-lipoic acid, vitamin C, and many others, are also being delivered intravenously in new “cutting edge” therapies. Carefully constructed binders are required so toxins are not reabsorbed into the bloodstream but are instead carried out of the body through the bowels. As acupuncturists, we must simultaneously clean and support the patient’s body to our best ability, because absurdly, the IV treatments described above are currently beyond our scope of practice. Some acupuncturists may choose to hire nurse practitioners or other professionals to perform these IV therapies. I am currently implementing these types of detox protocols with patients in my practice. •  Treatment should include a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas until the skin no longer colors. Bleeding of 99.08 Ear Apex, Tai Yang (temple area, avoiding the artery), LU5, UB40 and other appropriate points may be helpful. Because this typically is a treatment for the elderly, it is necessary to take a gentle approach over time, so as to avoid overwhelming the patient with too many needles. Be sure they have slept well and have eaten prior to your treatments. I have found a combination of Three Yellows and 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors to be the most effective, although I would never use all of these points together. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added to 77.18 Shen Guan and 77.21 Man Emperor, or you might add 77.18 Shen Guan to 88.12 Bright Yellow and 88.14 This Yellow. Then add 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20) or 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19) and 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) threaded through DU20 to clear the senses and calm the spirit, extinguish Liver wind and stabilize ascending yang. I often additionally needle 11.17 Wood (Anger) to address the underlying frustration and anger that living with Parkinson’s can create. LU5 can be needled or bled for tendon weakness and spasm. Dr. Young has said that PC3 Qu Ze, the He-Sea and water point on a fire meridian, is more effective than LU5 (33.16) because it is helpful for eliminating wind, due to the Jue Yin connection between the Pericardium and Liver meridians, and also because as a He-Sea water point, it tonifies Kidney qi for chronic diseases. Optional treatments: •  Calm tremors: Use 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20), 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), LV3 and LI4 (Four Gates) to resolve tremors and calm the nervous system. •  Weakness of the extremities (Parkinson’s disease): Thread a 3” needle from 1010.02 State Round (UB7) toward UB5 Da Zhu for Parkinson’s in the first year of treatment (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Drain damp heat: Unilaterally needle 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19), 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) (crossing needles at DU20). •  Formulas: The treatment principle is directed toward nourishing yin, dispelling wind and cleaning toxins; however, any herbal formula must be carefully customized to suit the individual. The following herbs and formulas may be helpful: Ling Yang Gou Teng Tang or herbs such as: Tian Ma, Gou Teng, Gui Ban, Mu Li, Bei Jia; Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin or Ding Zhen Wan (Pills for Calming Tremor). •  Bone spurs: Three Yellows can be selected for spine pain, but only if the pain is accompanied by some kind of liver-related condition, because we have so many choices when it comes to treating the spine. 88.12 Bright Yellow addresses bone spurs due to the internal/external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder, and because Bright Yellow is located directly opposite 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), and Shao Yang (GB) controls bones. Tung’s palm diagnosis: “Master Tung treated an emaciated man who had tuberculosis who was cured after two months of treatment. However, he could not raise his arm due to residual severe shoulder pain. After inspecting his palm and finding a dark-greenish spot in the area of the Liver/Spleen channel, Master Tung needled Three Yellows to relieve the shoulder pain” (Dr. Wang, 2013 quoting Dr. Chen, 1964).",

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 3 cun towards the femur. Superficial depth addresses KI, middle depth addresses LR, and deep level needling addresses HT. | Johnson: Dao Ma: 88.12 Bright Yellow (Chief Point), 88.13 Heaven Yellow, and 88.14 This Yellow are collectively known as Three Yellows, and are usually needled bilaterally, for a total of six needles. •  Palpation: Careful palpation of the Liver channel is essential to obtain the outstanding effects of these points. On any patient with severe liver disease, these points are excruciatingly painful to palpation, and they may be too sensitive to be needled during the first few treatments and/or premenstrually (use 11.20 Wood Inflammation). •  Needle bilaterally: After starting with a deep needle at the middle point, Bright Yellow, palpate softly for the proximal and distal points. Deep palpation would stimulate the needle at Bright Yellow, which could be uncomfortable for the patient.•  Needle depths: When using these points, deep needle insertion is essential and relates to the points’ Reaction Areas. A needle insertion of 1.0 cun is used for treatment at the Kidney level, 2.0 cun is good for Liver, and 3.0 cun also affects the Heart. Because blood diseases involve all three, I often use a 50mm needle insertion to connect them. If the patient is very thin or small, downsize to a 40mm needle, whereas a patient of average or larger size requires a 50mm or even 60mm needle. •  Needle gauge and bruising: When needling Three Yellows, place your consciousness in the tip of the needle so you can experience the resistance caused by larger blood vessels when it happens. A larger blood vessel feels like a smaller tendon in that it pushes back, in the same way a rubber band would if needled. Withdraw and slightly redirect the needle to move off of a blood vessel. I usually use a .20 x 50mm needle, which is the thinnest gauge available in 50mm needles (Japanese gauge 3, Chinese gauge 36). Some diseases are characterized by bruising, so go slowly and carefully to avoid unnecessary purpura. In a case of advanced cirrhosis, bruising is expected with these points; however, as the condition improves, the bruising will stop. •  Depth: 1.0-3.0 cun •  Kidney disease: 1.0 cun•  Liver disease: 2.0 cun•  Heart disease: 3.0 cun",
        "comments": "Three Yellows: Among all of Master Tung’s points, and among classic textbook points as well, none treat the liver in a more profound and lasting way than Three Yellows. They address liver organ disease and are not used to treat emotional issues due to Liver qi congestion. Though emotional issues are also likely to be present, liver disease trumps emotional states caused by Liver qi congestion, so we add 11.20 Wood Inflammation rather than 11.17 Wood (Anger), but never both, as that could make the patient feel ill. •  Energetic pathways: In TCM, we understand that the Spleen controls blood and the Liver restores blood. Three Yellows points are located on the Liver meridian, but because they are in close proximity to the Spleen channel, they regulate the functions of both the liver and spleen. This is one of my favorite point patterns to use in the treatment of blood diseases. Exhaustion due to liver: In the 1980s in San Francisco, I had an HIV/AIDS clinic where I treated a multitude of patients with hepatitis and liver disease. The effects of Three Yellows were outstanding. From treating these patients, I realized that exhaustion due to liver was entirely based upon the liver’s inability to clean the blood, and that any direct tonification of qi and blood would worsen the condition. With proper treatment, patients who previously had been carried into my office were able to climb the two flights of stairs to reach my clinic. Today, I use Three Yellows for any kind of exhaustion, even a headache, when it is caused by toxicity or Liver weakness. •  Hepatitis: Hepatitis A, B and C can be treated using the same basic protocol: Three Yellows, 11.20 Wood Inflammation, and a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. With hepatitis A and B, the herbal emphasis is on cleaning the blood. However, in the treatment of hepatitis C, the herbal prescription is radically different, utilizing the principles of tonifying Spleen qi, moistening Kidney yin, moving blood stagnation, and detoxifying the liver. •  Case history (hepatitis C with end-stage cirrhosis): For two years, three times weekly, I treated a 60-year-old female patient who had hepatitis C and end-stage cirrhosis. She presented with abdominal ascites, severe edema in the legs and feet, extremely itchy rashes, exhaustion, irritability, depression, insomnia and suicidal ideation. She tried to be cooperative but was unwilling to take any herbs. At that time, the hepatitis C drug Harvoni was being tested in trials but was unavailable to the general public. I cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, and a combination of Three Yellows/Three Emperors. We modified her diet to clear damp heat, avoid toxins and tonify the Spleen. At first, she had radical bruising along the Liver channel, as bleeding is a typical sign of end-stage cirrhosis. However, within three months, the bruising diminished and then stopped. Within a few weeks of her initial treatment, her itching subsided and the rashes cleared completely, though the water retention continued to be an intermittent concern that occasionally required the use of Lasix. Once Harvoni became available, she was cleared of hepatitis C, and the ascites receded. She is currently waiting for a liver transplant but is unlikely to receive it due to her age and condition. Given enough time, it is possible that this patient could have recovered completely; however, she was not cooperative enough to see it through, and she chose to abandon her dietary restrictions and regular treatments. •  Case history (hepatitis B): This patient was told he needed a liver transplant due to heroin abuse. Though he had been clean and sober for five years, he initially presented as jaundiced (green/gray/yellow) with nosebleeds, serious liver pain, back pain, exhaustion, headaches and insomnia. Because his Three Yellows points were extremely sensitive to palpation, he would not allow me to needle them for the first six weeks. I needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation with other, less sensitive points and prescribed a hepatitis B formula. I cupped the rib cage over the liver, being careful not to touch the swollen liver itself, and cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas on both sides. When his liver had recovered enough to tolerate my needling of Three Yellows, he would only allow it while holding on to my elbow so he could feel that he was in control. After six months of biweekly treatments, he was removed from the transplant list, and within a year he was in good health, riding his mountain bike all over town. He continued taking herbs for three years and remained healthy until he took a trip to Thailand and unfortunately relapsed into drug use. Case history (hepatitis in pregnancy): A 46-year-old presented with hepatitis B during pregnancy. She was exhausted, slightly jaundiced and afraid she might lose her baby. Because Three Yellows are extraordinary in treating exhaustion due to liver, and safe to needle during pregnancy, I needled them along with 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. I cupped her Toxin Areas and was able to give her a gentle liver cleansing formula, being very careful not to over-vitalize blood. After she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, we were able to use a stronger formula and permanently resolve her hepatitis B. She recently celebrated her 75th birthday and her daughter celebrated her 29th. •  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic predisposition for cysts in both the liver and kidneys. This kind of cyst formation ultimately leads to kidney failure, resulting in dialysis or a transplant. Early presentation may be as simple as slight lower back pain, slight hypertension, and nocturia. Patients with this disorder usually have a parent and/or sibling who are also dealing with it, and they should receive genetic counseling. Patients with PKD are usually monitored by their family physician or a nephrologist. It is essential that they eat a low-protein diet, as too much protein is extremely hard on the kidneys. •  Treatment: I have treated three cases of PKD using much the same approach. Because both the liver and kidneys are compromised, toxins may accumulate. Start with cleaning the toxins by: 1) cupping DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, 2) cupping over the ribs on top of the liver, and 3) very gently cupping the lower back over the kidneys, following the color. Combine 11.20 Wood Inflammation and Three Yellows with 77.18 Shen Guan, occasionally using all Three Emperors (77.18-77.21). A carefully constructed herbal formula is absolutely essential. If you are unable to create a formula of individual loose herbs, you must refer these patients to someone who can. •  Case history (PKD, early intervention and remission): My first patient with a diagnosis of PKD was a 50-year-old woman with two adult children. She presented with minor low back pain and moderately high blood pressure. After twelve months of daily loose herbs and biweekly acupuncture treatments, she was officially in remission, which is extremely rare with this condition. Her liver and kidney cysts disappeared, she was able to discontinue all blood pressure medications, and her blood pressure stayed low once it had been brought down. She no longer feared kidney failure. I had begun treatment as soon as her symptoms were recognized, which leads me to believe that early intervention is far more likely to be successful. •  Case history (PKD, moderately advanced): The second patient had moderately advanced PKD and a brain aneurism that required surgical repair. He had a very high-stress job, had three children and was undergoing a divorce. I was unsuccessful in lowering his blood pressure, the first obvious sign of PKD. His brain surgery interrupted our treatment during a critical time, and a few years later he required a kidney transplant. •  Case history (PKD, late intervention): The third patient was a 35-year-old woman whose mother had died at age 52 due to PKD, and whose older sister was already on dialysis. I urgently recommended that she begin treatment, explaining the difficulties of PKD and my one successful cure. Because her only symptom was a slightly elevated blood pressure, she chose alternatives of a spiritual nature, believing she could heal it on her own. Eighteen years later, she wound up in my office asking for help. At that time, the cysts had enlarged her kidneys by half their normal size. Her blood pressure required medications, she was tired, and her sleep patterns were erratic. I told her I was not sure if I could manage her case, but I would try. I gave her a powerful herbal formula for tonifying Liver and Kidneys while breaking cysts and vitalizing qi and blood. I modified the formula many times, and within eighteen months she was feeling better than she had in years, riding her bike, doing African dance, sleeping well, and working hard. Her kidneys had begun to shrink, though multiple cysts were still identified in both kidneys and the liver. We continued treatment two or three times weekly. I began to use granules instead of loose herbs, as she was planning a three-month trip to Europe. We had agreed to communicate over Skype at least every other week while she was away, but she discontinued communication with me once she arrived in Holland. Ten days before she was due to return to the United States, she called to tell me that she had seriously relapsed. When she returned, she told me that she had discontinued her herbs when she arrived in the Netherlands because she was convinced that she was healed, but in fact the herbs had been entirely supporting her. Ten weeks after she stopped taking the herbs, their effects completely wore off and she crashed. Though she was full of regret, we were unable to regain the lost ground. She recently had a kidney transplant, and her body is now attempting to regain balance and recognize itself under the influence of immunosuppressive drugs. Though she has regained some of her lost muscle mass and is feeling far better than she did just before the transplant, she feels a kind of internal shaking, is easily overwhelmed, and has very dark skin around her eyes. She continues to struggle with seriously heeding my warnings that she focus only on her health and discontinue any superfluous activity. She is overconfident and still unable to fully recognize how frail she is. She frequently overcommits herself and later regrets it. As much as I have come to love this patient and fight for her life, I cannot save her from herself. Her case is a mixed blessing and a good lesson to never take a winning streak for granted. It is my belief that we would have prevailed if her acupuncture and herbs had been uninterrupted. I think she could have avoided dialysis and therefore a transplant. Her kidneys never would have returned to normal, but the disease process would likely not have progressed, and she might have maintained her good health. •  Wind diseases: Wind diseases are characterized by their shifting nature. Three Yellows points are very useful in the treatment of wind diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Meniere’s, because they very powerfully expel wind while tonifying the Liver. Shaking diseases such as Parkinson’s always relate to both the Liver and Kidneys, so Three Yellows alone is not enough. In this disease, water is not nourishing wood, so the root (Kidney/water) also needs to be treated. Meniere’s disease involves the inner ear (the window to the Kidney); when treating Meniere’s we also need to consider both dizziness and vomiting (wind and phlegm). •  Dizziness and vertigo: There are numerous reasons for dizziness and vertigo. Careful differentiation is required because in some cases, there may be more than one causative factor. The three primary factors are: excess Liver wind (including internal wind with external wind), Kidney yin or yang deficiency (or both), and blood deficiency. •  Meniere’s treatment: Meniere’s disease will return, usually in the springtime, if you do not completely resolve it. Three Yellows points are the best choice for treating Meniere’s disease, as it is an exacerbation of internal wind meeting external wind. To bilateral Three Yellows, add either LI11 Qu Chi or 22.05 Ling Gu, and PC6 Nei Guan, needled unilaterally. It is important to minimize the number of needles when treating wind diseases. Alternatively, consider 88.17-88.19 Four Horses when treating internal ear diseases, such as Meniere’s or Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) is always a good option for wind diseases and internal ear pathologies, and it may be added to either Three Yellows or Four Horses, though its influence is already there. 44.07 Back Face (LI15) may be bled. •  LI11 Qu Chi is the He-Sea point on the Large Intestine channel and the primary TCM point for eliminating wind. It can be used for qi reversal and exterior conditions, and it cools heat, clears dampness, and regulates the blood, making it ideal in the treatment of all kinds of dizziness and vertigo. It utilizes a special internal relationship between the Yang Ming and Jue Yin channels (LI/LV), as well as the Yang Ming internal/external relationship with Stomach, giving it a strong qi and blood connection as well. 22.05 Ling Gu uses these same relationships and additionally tonifies the Kidney. Remember, choices need to be made to minimize the number of needles, so be selective rather than including all possible options (what I call “kitchen sinking”). •  PC6 Nei Guan is frequently used in this combination because it treats nausea and vomiting, which are common problems when vertigo is present. It additionally shares the Jue Yin connection to the Liver as well as a special internal connection to the Yang Ming (PC/ST). •  GB31 Wind Market mimics the effects of its counterpart, 88.12 Bright Yellow, and may also be added to Three Yellows, especially when it is used to treat blood diseases, particularly those involving the bone marrow and/or Liver wind. •  44.07 Back Face (LI15) is commonly bled for Meniere’s disease due to the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming and Foot Jue Yin (LI/LV) and also the internal/external Liver and Gallbladder connection. Back Face is also useful for tinnitus and sudden deafness, for the same reasons. This point raises the pure qi and is also used for exhaustion and vomiting, similar to 1010.07 All Pivot for heat stroke. •  Epley Maneuver: Do a Google search for instructional videos to learn how to apply the Epley Maneuver, which is used to dislodge crystals found in the semicircular ducts of the inner ear. Make sure that patients with Meniere’s disease have someone to drive them home after undergoing this procedure, as they may immediately experience severe vertigo and even vomiting, which will then resolve. •  Meniere’s formula: Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang and Er Chen Tang (Citrus and Pinellia Formula). Use Lychi and Chrysanthemum (Ji Gu Di Huang) to treat long term. •  Dizziness due to Kidney deficiency: Kidney deficiency is the most commonly seen cause of dizziness in the clinic; this can be either yin or yang deficiency, or both, and it most frequently affects the elderly. By far the best treatment in these cases is bilateral 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, because 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) is Master Tung’s master Kidney point. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added, or Shen Guan may be added to 88.12 and 88.14 Two Yellows to tonify water and eliminate wind while simultaneously building blood and minimizing the number of needles. 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai also can be used in these cases, as they are specific for dizziness and utilize the special internal relationship between the Shao Yang and Shao Yin (SJ/KD). •  Dizziness due to blood diseases: Three Yellows are my favorite points for treating blood diseases, although in Tung’s acupuncture we might also consider 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop. Choices are made relative to diagnosis and presentation. Of the three options, I have found Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to be the least effective, though I love these points for other uses. When treating Liver blood deficiency, I always choose Three Yellows because it tonifies and strengthens the Liver to clean the blood and expel wind. If the patient is also Spleen qi deficient, I might use Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment (bilateral ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7), with or without moxa on ST36 and SP6. Three Weights are chosen for blood diseases because they are located on the Gallbladder channel, adjacent to GB39 (the Sea of Marrow), and they affect both the Liver, which governs the blood, and the Spleen, which controls the blood. They disperse both wind and phlegm and are often used to increase circulation to the head and/or brain. Moxa on the Ming Men and REN4-REN8 is also very useful in building blood. •  Parkinson’s disease: There is still much to be learned to better understand Parkinson’s disease; however, the latest research implies that a buildup of endotoxins and environmental toxins (from heavy metals and other sources) in the brain causes a cascade of effects, including debilitating neurological deficits, dementia and depression. Functional medicine is on the brink of great discoveries with regard to detoxification protocols and immune system recovery through rebuilding the microbiome and restoring proper bile flow, thus reinstating detoxification pathways that have failed. Unfortunately, much irreversible damage has already been done, and it is predicted that in the relatively near future, 50% of all males will suffer from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Brain toxicity has now replaced amyloid plaque as the causative factor in Alzheimer’s. Major contributors are mercury (in fish and amalgams) and aluminum found in vaccines, which are often pushed upon unsuspecting populations around the world. Excessive amounts of lead, iron and copper are now frequently found in human bodies, as well as molds, parasites, viruses and retroviruses. Food and water sources are contaminated around the globe, and the desire to remain ignorant plagues any hope for a timely resolution. Also, overuse of antibiotics, NSAIDs and steroids have certainly played a part. That said, in the treatment of Parkinson’s, we can only do our best to protect any remaining neurons from further degeneration. •  Parkinson’s in TCM: In TCM, Parkinson’s is viewed as a shaking disease due to phlegm, fire, and wind. Because it is nearly always found in patients over the age of sixty, we want to avoid overtreatment and over-sedation by streamlining our protocols, using the fewest number of needles to achieve the best results. Cleaning toxins from the body (blood and brain) is paramount. I believe that in the near future, this will best be accomplished via intravenous delivery of agents that restore bile flow, stabilize mast cells and upregulate Nrf2. Substances such as phosphatidylcholine, glutathione, quercetin, r-lipoic acid, vitamin C, and many others, are also being delivered intravenously in new “cutting edge” therapies. Carefully constructed binders are required so toxins are not reabsorbed into the bloodstream but are instead carried out of the body through the bowels. As acupuncturists, we must simultaneously clean and support the patient’s body to our best ability, because absurdly, the IV treatments described above are currently beyond our scope of practice. Some acupuncturists may choose to hire nurse practitioners or other professionals to perform these IV therapies. I am currently implementing these types of detox protocols with patients in my practice. •  Treatment should include a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas until the skin no longer colors. Bleeding of 99.08 Ear Apex, Tai Yang (temple area, avoiding the artery), LU5, UB40 and other appropriate points may be helpful. Because this typically is a treatment for the elderly, it is necessary to take a gentle approach over time, so as to avoid overwhelming the patient with too many needles. Be sure they have slept well and have eaten prior to your treatments. I have found a combination of Three Yellows and 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors to be the most effective, although I would never use all of these points together. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added to 77.18 Shen Guan and 77.21 Man Emperor, or you might add 77.18 Shen Guan to 88.12 Bright Yellow and 88.14 This Yellow. Then add 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20) or 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19) and 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) threaded through DU20 to clear the senses and calm the spirit, extinguish Liver wind and stabilize ascending yang. I often additionally needle 11.17 Wood (Anger) to address the underlying frustration and anger that living with Parkinson’s can create. LU5 can be needled or bled for tendon weakness and spasm. Dr. Young has said that PC3 Qu Ze, the He-Sea and water point on a fire meridian, is more effective than LU5 (33.16) because it is helpful for eliminating wind, due to the Jue Yin connection between the Pericardium and Liver meridians, and also because as a He-Sea water point, it tonifies Kidney qi for chronic diseases. Optional treatments: •  Calm tremors: Use 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20), 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), LV3 and LI4 (Four Gates) to resolve tremors and calm the nervous system. •  Weakness of the extremities (Parkinson’s disease): Thread a 3” needle from 1010.02 State Round (UB7) toward UB5 Da Zhu for Parkinson’s in the first year of treatment (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Drain damp heat: Unilaterally needle 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19), 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) (crossing needles at DU20). •  Formulas: The treatment principle is directed toward nourishing yin, dispelling wind and cleaning toxins; however, any herbal formula must be carefully customized to suit the individual. The following herbs and formulas may be helpful: Ling Yang Gou Teng Tang or herbs such as: Tian Ma, Gou Teng, Gui Ban, Mu Li, Bei Jia; Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin or Ding Zhen Wan (Pills for Calming Tremor). •  Bone spurs: Three Yellows can be selected for spine pain, but only if the pain is accompanied by some kind of liver-related condition, because we have so many choices when it comes to treating the spine. 88.12 Bright Yellow addresses bone spurs due to the internal/external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder, and because Bright Yellow is located directly opposite 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), and Shao Yang (GB) controls bones. Tung’s palm diagnosis: “Master Tung treated an emaciated man who had tuberculosis who was cured after two months of treatment. However, he could not raise his arm due to residual severe shoulder pain. After inspecting his palm and finding a dark-greenish spot in the area of the Liver/Spleen channel, Master Tung needled Three Yellows to relieve the shoulder pain” (Dr. Wang, 2013 quoting Dr. Chen, 1964).",
        "combinations": "Liver cancer or disease: 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows. •  Hepatitis: 11.20 Wood Inflammation with 88.12- 88.14 Three Yellows, add 33.10 Intestine Gate and 33.11 Liver Gate for better effect. Consider ST36, SP9, UB18, LV3. •  Cirrhosis: Bleed UB18-UB20 (LV, GB and SP Shu Points). Unilaterally needle left-side 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.11 Liver Gate, SI4 Wan Gu; bilaterally needle 88.12- 88.14 Three Yellows. Also consider 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop. •  Meniere’s disease: Bilaterally needle 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows; needle 22.05 Ling Gu or LI11 Qu Chi (classic TCM point for dizziness) on one side, PC6 Nei Guan (only if there is nausea and vomiting) on the other side. •  Chronic dizziness (due to Kidney deficiency): Bilaterally needle 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, 22.06-22.07 Middle White/Lower White. •  Tiredness with dizziness: 88.12 Bright Yellow with 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors. •  Parkinson’s disease: 88.12-88.14 Two Yellows (choose two points only) with 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors, needle DU19 and DU21 directed toward DU20. •  Alternative treatment: Bilaterally needle 88.12- 88.14 Three Yellows, PC3 Qu Ze. •  To drain damp heat: Needle left-side 33.10 Intestine Gate and 33.11 Liver Gate. •  Shaky or weak legs: 88.12 Bright Yellow with 77.18-77.21 Two Emperors or 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows with 77.18 Shen Guan. •  Scoliosis: Glass cup the entire back; bamboo cup the spine; bilaterally needle 88.12- 88.14 Three Yellows, add DU26 Ren Zhong, LI11 Qu Chi, UB60 Kun Lun. Consider moxa on UB18 Gan Shu and UB20 Pi Shu (LV and SP Shu Points). Alternatively needle: SI3 Hou Xi, UB65 Shu Gu, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) and DU26 Ren Zhong (Dr. Young’s bone spur treatment). •  Canker sores: Edgar Cayce’s Ipsab tincture is miraculous for canker sores, reducing them by fifty percent overnight. Saturate a wisp of cotton with the tincture and place it between the cheek and gum. Needling 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows may also help with mouth sores, though I prefer Ipsab. •  Blood diseases: 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows, 77.18 Shen Guan (see Comments above). •  Digestive problems (due to wood attacking earth): 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows. •  Eye Pain (due to Liver excess): 55.02 Flower Bone One; 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows; 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2), 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3). •  Eye pain (due to deficiency): 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows, 77.28 Light Bright.",

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 3 cun perpendicularly towards the femur. Superficial depth addresses KI, middle depth addresses the LR, and deep level needling addresses the HT. | Johnson: Dao Ma: 88.12 Bright Yellow (Chief Point), 88.13 Heaven Yellow, and 88.14 This Yellow are collectively known as Three Yellows, and are usually needled bilaterally, for a total of six needles. •  Palpation: Careful palpation of the Liver channel is essential to obtain the outstanding effects of these points. On any patient with severe liver disease, these points are excruciatingly painful to palpation, and they may be too sensitive to be needled during the first few treatments and/or premenstrually (use 11.20 Wood Inflammation). •  Needle bilaterally: After starting with a deep needle at the middle point, Bright Yellow, palpate softly for the proximal and distal points. Deep palpation would stimulate the needle at Bright Yellow, which could be uncomfortable for the patient.•  Needle depths: When using these points, deep needle insertion is essential and relates to the points’ Reaction Areas. A needle insertion of 1.0 cun is used for treatment at the Kidney level, 2.0 cun is good for Liver, and 3.0 cun also affects the Heart. Because blood diseases involve all three, I often use a 50mm needle insertion to connect them. If the patient is very thin or small, downsize to a 40mm needle, whereas a patient of average or larger size requires a 50mm or even 60mm needle. •  Needle gauge and bruising: When needling Three Yellows, place your consciousness in the tip of the needle so you can experience the resistance caused by larger blood vessels when it happens. A larger blood vessel feels like a smaller tendon in that it pushes back, in the same way a rubber band would if needled. Withdraw and slightly redirect the needle to move off of a blood vessel. I usually use a .20 x 50mm needle, which is the thinnest gauge available in 50mm needles (Japanese gauge 3, Chinese gauge 36). Some diseases are characterized by bruising, so go slowly and carefully to avoid unnecessary purpura. In a case of advanced cirrhosis, bruising is expected with these points; however, as the condition improves, the bruising will stop. •  Depth: 1.0-3.0 cun •  Kidney disease: 1.0 cun•  Liver disease: 2.0 cun•  Heart disease: 3.0 cun",
        "comments": "Three Yellows: Among all of Master Tung’s points, and among classic textbook points as well, none treat the liver in a more profound and lasting way than Three Yellows. They address liver organ disease and are not used to treat emotional issues due to Liver qi congestion. Though emotional issues are also likely to be present, liver disease trumps emotional states caused by Liver qi congestion, so we add 11.20 Wood Inflammation rather than 11.17 Wood (Anger), but never both, as that could make the patient feel ill. •  Energetic pathways: In TCM, we understand that the Spleen controls blood and the Liver restores blood. Three Yellows points are located on the Liver meridian, but because they are in close proximity to the Spleen channel, they regulate the functions of both the liver and spleen. This is one of my favorite point patterns to use in the treatment of blood diseases. Exhaustion due to liver: In the 1980s in San Francisco, I had an HIV/AIDS clinic where I treated a multitude of patients with hepatitis and liver disease. The effects of Three Yellows were outstanding. From treating these patients, I realized that exhaustion due to liver was entirely based upon the liver’s inability to clean the blood, and that any direct tonification of qi and blood would worsen the condition. With proper treatment, patients who previously had been carried into my office were able to climb the two flights of stairs to reach my clinic. Today, I use Three Yellows for any kind of exhaustion, even a headache, when it is caused by toxicity or Liver weakness. •  Hepatitis: Hepatitis A, B and C can be treated using the same basic protocol: Three Yellows, 11.20 Wood Inflammation, and a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. With hepatitis A and B, the herbal emphasis is on cleaning the blood. However, in the treatment of hepatitis C, the herbal prescription is radically different, utilizing the principles of tonifying Spleen qi, moistening Kidney yin, moving blood stagnation, and detoxifying the liver. •  Case history (hepatitis C with end-stage cirrhosis): For two years, three times weekly, I treated a 60-year-old female patient who had hepatitis C and end-stage cirrhosis. She presented with abdominal ascites, severe edema in the legs and feet, extremely itchy rashes, exhaustion, irritability, depression, insomnia and suicidal ideation. She tried to be cooperative but was unwilling to take any herbs. At that time, the hepatitis C drug Harvoni was being tested in trials but was unavailable to the general public. I cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, and a combination of Three Yellows/Three Emperors. We modified her diet to clear damp heat, avoid toxins and tonify the Spleen. At first, she had radical bruising along the Liver channel, as bleeding is a typical sign of end-stage cirrhosis. However, within three months, the bruising diminished and then stopped. Within a few weeks of her initial treatment, her itching subsided and the rashes cleared completely, though the water retention continued to be an intermittent concern that occasionally required the use of Lasix. Once Harvoni became available, she was cleared of hepatitis C, and the ascites receded. She is currently waiting for a liver transplant but is unlikely to receive it due to her age and condition. Given enough time, it is possible that this patient could have recovered completely; however, she was not cooperative enough to see it through, and she chose to abandon her dietary restrictions and regular treatments. •  Case history (hepatitis B): This patient was told he needed a liver transplant due to heroin abuse. Though he had been clean and sober for five years, he initially presented as jaundiced (green/gray/yellow) with nosebleeds, serious liver pain, back pain, exhaustion, headaches and insomnia. Because his Three Yellows points were extremely sensitive to palpation, he would not allow me to needle them for the first six weeks. I needled 11.20 Wood Inflammation with other, less sensitive points and prescribed a hepatitis B formula. I cupped the rib cage over the liver, being careful not to touch the swollen liver itself, and cupped the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas on both sides. When his liver had recovered enough to tolerate my needling of Three Yellows, he would only allow it while holding on to my elbow so he could feel that he was in control. After six months of biweekly treatments, he was removed from the transplant list, and within a year he was in good health, riding his mountain bike all over town. He continued taking herbs for three years and remained healthy until he took a trip to Thailand and unfortunately relapsed into drug use. Case history (hepatitis in pregnancy): A 46-year-old presented with hepatitis B during pregnancy. She was exhausted, slightly jaundiced and afraid she might lose her baby. Because Three Yellows are extraordinary in treating exhaustion due to liver, and safe to needle during pregnancy, I needled them along with 11.20 Wood Inflammation, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. I cupped her Toxin Areas and was able to give her a gentle liver cleansing formula, being very careful not to over-vitalize blood. After she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, we were able to use a stronger formula and permanently resolve her hepatitis B. She recently celebrated her 75th birthday and her daughter celebrated her 29th. •  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD): Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic predisposition for cysts in both the liver and kidneys. This kind of cyst formation ultimately leads to kidney failure, resulting in dialysis or a transplant. Early presentation may be as simple as slight lower back pain, slight hypertension, and nocturia. Patients with this disorder usually have a parent and/or sibling who are also dealing with it, and they should receive genetic counseling. Patients with PKD are usually monitored by their family physician or a nephrologist. It is essential that they eat a low-protein diet, as too much protein is extremely hard on the kidneys. •  Treatment: I have treated three cases of PKD using much the same approach. Because both the liver and kidneys are compromised, toxins may accumulate. Start with cleaning the toxins by: 1) cupping DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas, 2) cupping over the ribs on top of the liver, and 3) very gently cupping the lower back over the kidneys, following the color. Combine 11.20 Wood Inflammation and Three Yellows with 77.18 Shen Guan, occasionally using all Three Emperors (77.18-77.21). A carefully constructed herbal formula is absolutely essential. If you are unable to create a formula of individual loose herbs, you must refer these patients to someone who can. •  Case history (PKD, early intervention and remission): My first patient with a diagnosis of PKD was a 50-year-old woman with two adult children. She presented with minor low back pain and moderately high blood pressure. After twelve months of daily loose herbs and biweekly acupuncture treatments, she was officially in remission, which is extremely rare with this condition. Her liver and kidney cysts disappeared, she was able to discontinue all blood pressure medications, and her blood pressure stayed low once it had been brought down. She no longer feared kidney failure. I had begun treatment as soon as her symptoms were recognized, which leads me to believe that early intervention is far more likely to be successful. •  Case history (PKD, moderately advanced): The second patient had moderately advanced PKD and a brain aneurism that required surgical repair. He had a very high-stress job, had three children and was undergoing a divorce. I was unsuccessful in lowering his blood pressure, the first obvious sign of PKD. His brain surgery interrupted our treatment during a critical time, and a few years later he required a kidney transplant. •  Case history (PKD, late intervention): The third patient was a 35-year-old woman whose mother had died at age 52 due to PKD, and whose older sister was already on dialysis. I urgently recommended that she begin treatment, explaining the difficulties of PKD and my one successful cure. Because her only symptom was a slightly elevated blood pressure, she chose alternatives of a spiritual nature, believing she could heal it on her own. Eighteen years later, she wound up in my office asking for help. At that time, the cysts had enlarged her kidneys by half their normal size. Her blood pressure required medications, she was tired, and her sleep patterns were erratic. I told her I was not sure if I could manage her case, but I would try. I gave her a powerful herbal formula for tonifying Liver and Kidneys while breaking cysts and vitalizing qi and blood. I modified the formula many times, and within eighteen months she was feeling better than she had in years, riding her bike, doing African dance, sleeping well, and working hard. Her kidneys had begun to shrink, though multiple cysts were still identified in both kidneys and the liver. We continued treatment two or three times weekly. I began to use granules instead of loose herbs, as she was planning a three-month trip to Europe. We had agreed to communicate over Skype at least every other week while she was away, but she discontinued communication with me once she arrived in Holland. Ten days before she was due to return to the United States, she called to tell me that she had seriously relapsed. When she returned, she told me that she had discontinued her herbs when she arrived in the Netherlands because she was convinced that she was healed, but in fact the herbs had been entirely supporting her. Ten weeks after she stopped taking the herbs, their effects completely wore off and she crashed. Though she was full of regret, we were unable to regain the lost ground. She recently had a kidney transplant, and her body is now attempting to regain balance and recognize itself under the influence of immunosuppressive drugs. Though she has regained some of her lost muscle mass and is feeling far better than she did just before the transplant, she feels a kind of internal shaking, is easily overwhelmed, and has very dark skin around her eyes. She continues to struggle with seriously heeding my warnings that she focus only on her health and discontinue any superfluous activity. She is overconfident and still unable to fully recognize how frail she is. She frequently overcommits herself and later regrets it. As much as I have come to love this patient and fight for her life, I cannot save her from herself. Her case is a mixed blessing and a good lesson to never take a winning streak for granted. It is my belief that we would have prevailed if her acupuncture and herbs had been uninterrupted. I think she could have avoided dialysis and therefore a transplant. Her kidneys never would have returned to normal, but the disease process would likely not have progressed, and she might have maintained her good health. •  Wind diseases: Wind diseases are characterized by their shifting nature. Three Yellows points are very useful in the treatment of wind diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Meniere’s, because they very powerfully expel wind while tonifying the Liver. Shaking diseases such as Parkinson’s always relate to both the Liver and Kidneys, so Three Yellows alone is not enough. In this disease, water is not nourishing wood, so the root (Kidney/water) also needs to be treated. Meniere’s disease involves the inner ear (the window to the Kidney); when treating Meniere’s we also need to consider both dizziness and vomiting (wind and phlegm). •  Dizziness and vertigo: There are numerous reasons for dizziness and vertigo. Careful differentiation is required because in some cases, there may be more than one causative factor. The three primary factors are: excess Liver wind (including internal wind with external wind), Kidney yin or yang deficiency (or both), and blood deficiency. •  Meniere’s treatment: Meniere’s disease will return, usually in the springtime, if you do not completely resolve it. Three Yellows points are the best choice for treating Meniere’s disease, as it is an exacerbation of internal wind meeting external wind. To bilateral Three Yellows, add either LI11 Qu Chi or 22.05 Ling Gu, and PC6 Nei Guan, needled unilaterally. It is important to minimize the number of needles when treating wind diseases. Alternatively, consider 88.17-88.19 Four Horses when treating internal ear diseases, such as Meniere’s or Mal de Débarquement Syndrome. 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) is always a good option for wind diseases and internal ear pathologies, and it may be added to either Three Yellows or Four Horses, though its influence is already there. 44.07 Back Face (LI15) may be bled. •  LI11 Qu Chi is the He-Sea point on the Large Intestine channel and the primary TCM point for eliminating wind. It can be used for qi reversal and exterior conditions, and it cools heat, clears dampness, and regulates the blood, making it ideal in the treatment of all kinds of dizziness and vertigo. It utilizes a special internal relationship between the Yang Ming and Jue Yin channels (LI/LV), as well as the Yang Ming internal/external relationship with Stomach, giving it a strong qi and blood connection as well. 22.05 Ling Gu uses these same relationships and additionally tonifies the Kidney. Remember, choices need to be made to minimize the number of needles, so be selective rather than including all possible options (what I call “kitchen sinking”). •  PC6 Nei Guan is frequently used in this combination because it treats nausea and vomiting, which are common problems when vertigo is present. It additionally shares the Jue Yin connection to the Liver as well as a special internal connection to the Yang Ming (PC/ST). •  GB31 Wind Market mimics the effects of its counterpart, 88.12 Bright Yellow, and may also be added to Three Yellows, especially when it is used to treat blood diseases, particularly those involving the bone marrow and/or Liver wind. •  44.07 Back Face (LI15) is commonly bled for Meniere’s disease due to the special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming and Foot Jue Yin (LI/LV) and also the internal/external Liver and Gallbladder connection. Back Face is also useful for tinnitus and sudden deafness, for the same reasons. This point raises the pure qi and is also used for exhaustion and vomiting, similar to 1010.07 All Pivot for heat stroke. •  Epley Maneuver: Do a Google search for instructional videos to learn how to apply the Epley Maneuver, which is used to dislodge crystals found in the semicircular ducts of the inner ear. Make sure that patients with Meniere’s disease have someone to drive them home after undergoing this procedure, as they may immediately experience severe vertigo and even vomiting, which will then resolve. •  Meniere’s formula: Ban Xia Bai Zhu Tian Ma Tang and Er Chen Tang (Citrus and Pinellia Formula). Use Lychi and Chrysanthemum (Ji Gu Di Huang) to treat long term. •  Dizziness due to Kidney deficiency: Kidney deficiency is the most commonly seen cause of dizziness in the clinic; this can be either yin or yang deficiency, or both, and it most frequently affects the elderly. By far the best treatment in these cases is bilateral 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, because 77.18 Shen Guan (Kidney Gate) is Master Tung’s master Kidney point. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added, or Shen Guan may be added to 88.12 and 88.14 Two Yellows to tonify water and eliminate wind while simultaneously building blood and minimizing the number of needles. 22.06-22.07 Zhong Bai/Xia Bai also can be used in these cases, as they are specific for dizziness and utilize the special internal relationship between the Shao Yang and Shao Yin (SJ/KD). •  Dizziness due to blood diseases: Three Yellows are my favorite points for treating blood diseases, although in Tung’s acupuncture we might also consider 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop. Choices are made relative to diagnosis and presentation. Of the three options, I have found Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to be the least effective, though I love these points for other uses. When treating Liver blood deficiency, I always choose Three Yellows because it tonifies and strengthens the Liver to clean the blood and expel wind. If the patient is also Spleen qi deficient, I might use Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment (bilateral ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7), with or without moxa on ST36 and SP6. Three Weights are chosen for blood diseases because they are located on the Gallbladder channel, adjacent to GB39 (the Sea of Marrow), and they affect both the Liver, which governs the blood, and the Spleen, which controls the blood. They disperse both wind and phlegm and are often used to increase circulation to the head and/or brain. Moxa on the Ming Men and REN4-REN8 is also very useful in building blood. •  Parkinson’s disease: There is still much to be learned to better understand Parkinson’s disease; however, the latest research implies that a buildup of endotoxins and environmental toxins (from heavy metals and other sources) in the brain causes a cascade of effects, including debilitating neurological deficits, dementia and depression. Functional medicine is on the brink of great discoveries with regard to detoxification protocols and immune system recovery through rebuilding the microbiome and restoring proper bile flow, thus reinstating detoxification pathways that have failed. Unfortunately, much irreversible damage has already been done, and it is predicted that in the relatively near future, 50% of all males will suffer from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Brain toxicity has now replaced amyloid plaque as the causative factor in Alzheimer’s. Major contributors are mercury (in fish and amalgams) and aluminum found in vaccines, which are often pushed upon unsuspecting populations around the world. Excessive amounts of lead, iron and copper are now frequently found in human bodies, as well as molds, parasites, viruses and retroviruses. Food and water sources are contaminated around the globe, and the desire to remain ignorant plagues any hope for a timely resolution. Also, overuse of antibiotics, NSAIDs and steroids have certainly played a part. That said, in the treatment of Parkinson’s, we can only do our best to protect any remaining neurons from further degeneration. •  Parkinson’s in TCM: In TCM, Parkinson’s is viewed as a shaking disease due to phlegm, fire, and wind. Because it is nearly always found in patients over the age of sixty, we want to avoid overtreatment and over-sedation by streamlining our protocols, using the fewest number of needles to achieve the best results. Cleaning toxins from the body (blood and brain) is paramount. I believe that in the near future, this will best be accomplished via intravenous delivery of agents that restore bile flow, stabilize mast cells and upregulate Nrf2. Substances such as phosphatidylcholine, glutathione, quercetin, r-lipoic acid, vitamin C, and many others, are also being delivered intravenously in new “cutting edge” therapies. Carefully constructed binders are required so toxins are not reabsorbed into the bloodstream but are instead carried out of the body through the bowels. As acupuncturists, we must simultaneously clean and support the patient’s body to our best ability, because absurdly, the IV treatments described above are currently beyond our scope of practice. Some acupuncturists may choose to hire nurse practitioners or other professionals to perform these IV therapies. I am currently implementing these types of detox protocols with patients in my practice. •  Treatment should include a thorough cupping of the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas until the skin no longer colors. Bleeding of 99.08 Ear Apex, Tai Yang (temple area, avoiding the artery), LU5, UB40 and other appropriate points may be helpful. Because this typically is a treatment for the elderly, it is necessary to take a gentle approach over time, so as to avoid overwhelming the patient with too many needles. Be sure they have slept well and have eaten prior to your treatments. I have found a combination of Three Yellows and 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors to be the most effective, although I would never use all of these points together. 88.12 Bright Yellow may be added to 77.18 Shen Guan and 77.21 Man Emperor, or you might add 77.18 Shen Guan to 88.12 Bright Yellow and 88.14 This Yellow. Then add 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20) or 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19) and 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) threaded through DU20 to clear the senses and calm the spirit, extinguish Liver wind and stabilize ascending yang. I often additionally needle 11.17 Wood (Anger) to address the underlying frustration and anger that living with Parkinson’s can create. LU5 can be needled or bled for tendon weakness and spasm. Dr. Young has said that PC3 Qu Ze, the He-Sea and water point on a fire meridian, is more effective than LU5 (33.16) because it is helpful for eliminating wind, due to the Jue Yin connection between the Pericardium and Liver meridians, and also because as a He-Sea water point, it tonifies Kidney qi for chronic diseases. Optional treatments: •  Calm tremors: Use 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20), 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), LV3 and LI4 (Four Gates) to resolve tremors and calm the nervous system. •  Weakness of the extremities (Parkinson’s disease): Thread a 3” needle from 1010.02 State Round (UB7) toward UB5 Da Zhu for Parkinson’s in the first year of treatment (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Drain damp heat: Unilaterally needle 33.10 Intestine Gate, 33.11 Liver Gate, 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19), 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) (crossing needles at DU20). •  Formulas: The treatment principle is directed toward nourishing yin, dispelling wind and cleaning toxins; however, any herbal formula must be carefully customized to suit the individual. The following herbs and formulas may be helpful: Ling Yang Gou Teng Tang or herbs such as: Tian Ma, Gou Teng, Gui Ban, Mu Li, Bei Jia; Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin or Ding Zhen Wan (Pills for Calming Tremor). •  Bone spurs: Three Yellows can be selected for spine pain, but only if the pain is accompanied by some kind of liver-related condition, because we have so many choices when it comes to treating the spine. 88.12 Bright Yellow addresses bone spurs due to the internal/external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder, and because Bright Yellow is located directly opposite 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), and Shao Yang (GB) controls bones. Tung’s palm diagnosis: “Master Tung treated an emaciated man who had tuberculosis who was cured after two months of treatment. However, he could not raise his arm due to residual severe shoulder pain. After inspecting his palm and finding a dark-greenish spot in the area of the Liver/Spleen channel, Master Tung needled Three Yellows to relieve the shoulder pain” (Dr. Wang, 2013 quoting Dr. Chen, 1964).",

        "comments": "Detoxification, a big-picture view: Gallbladder inflammation, including sludge, stones and bile flow disruption, can cause a cascading effect of toxins in the bloodstream and therefore throughout all of the body’s tissues. Some people’s bodies are more capable of processing certain toxins than others, but everyone has residual toxins of some kind built up in their body. Whether one experiences the side effects of chemicals, molds, funguses, parasites, heavy metals, and/or pharmaceuticals depends upon the efficiency of the bile tree in the liver and the state of the gallbladder’s bile receptivity and flow. If the hepatocytes of the liver are overwhelmed by a myriad of toxins, or if the gallbladder is congested (or completely blocked), the result may be a shunting of unprocessed toxin buildup back into the bloodstream in order to dilute the toxins, save the hepatocytes, and temporarily postpone detoxification. This creates further pollution in the body, so it is absolutely essential that efficient bile flow is restored and maintained. There have always been environmental toxins and endotoxins requiring elimination by the body, but never in history have humans experienced the levels of toxicity currently found inside and outside of our bodies. •  Neurological disease epidemic: The worldwide rate of neurological disease in children has doubled since 2012. In the 1950s, one child in 5,000 was diagnosed as being somewhere on the autism spectrum. In 2012, it was one child in 88, and now one in 44 children has obvious neurological degeneration. Some people argue that we are now better at diagnosing autism, ADD, ADHD, and the like. However, one only needs to sit in the presence of a child who is unable to make eye contact or verbally communicate, and who self-soothes by hitting their head against a wall, to recognize that our species is in great jeopardy of biological and fiscal demise. Within the time span of two U.S. presidencies, our nation will be unable to care for a generation of disabled children as well as two generations of the elderly who are dealing with Alzheimer’s, dementia, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis and other neurologically degenerative diseases. •  Detoxification strategies: Though our global community faces a bleak picture and a daunting task, we are simultaneously at the cutting edge of discovering methods of recovering our physical and mental health. Scientists are researching ways to restore our body’s natural detox pathways (bile flow) and protective mechanisms such as the microbiome. •  The microbiome (part one): The microbiome is the body’s built-in immune system, sometimes referred to as the “gut microbiome.” Leading authorities no longer recommend probiotics; they say that each individual’s microbiome is so unique that the idea of supplementing it with a prescribed probiotic is now thought to be ludicrous. The latest research demonstrates that the microbiome is comprised of over 4,000 different types of flora (such as bacteria, molds, fungi, parasites, spirochetes, viruses and retroviruses), from which many details can be determined about an individual, including their sex and race, where they live, whether their birth was vaginal or by caesarian section, and if they were breast fed. One’s microbiome changes from one instant to the next, in response to new smells and environments, foods and chemical or environmental exposures. The health of the microbiome is essential for adequate immune response, and it will be a major part of future medical diagnostics as well as the restoration of bile flow and detox pathways. Researchers who study the microbiome are unknowingly reviving the concepts of the TCM “Earth School” in modern medicine. It is a very exciting time in the realm of study about autoimmune diseases, lymph drainage and the lymphatic system, including brain detoxification. See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses for “The microbiome (part two).” •  Ketogenesis and autophagy: Researchers are also recognizing our innate capacity to fuel the brain and body primarily through the metabolism of fat (ketogenesis – the old Atkins Diet model, recently revived), restoring the biological flexibility of our hunter/gatherer ancestors in using both glucose and fat as fuel. When we burn fat as fuel, it allows for a process known as autophagy, the body’s innate ability to rid itself of damaged, toxic, or unused cells. Though humans have always been able to metabolize sugar and fat, most modern brains operate on glucose alone. It has been proven that fat is a much cleaner fuel source without the devastating side effects that have grown out of the sole reliance upon glucose, which is insidious in contemporary cuisines and results in untold inflammation and metabolic syndromes. •  Parasympathetic pathways: All of the detoxification processes occurring within the human body are part of parasympathetic nervous system pathways. This means when the body is engaged in the “fight or flight” response of the sympathetic nervous system, detoxification will never take priority. The chronic, constant stress level of today’s society, a primary cause of our overactive sympathetic systems, must be addressed before – or at least simultaneously with – any other “downstream” interventions. In this regard, Oriental medicine, including Tai Chi, Qi Gong, meditation, acupuncture and herbal medicine, as well as a plethora of other mental, emotional, spiritual, and integrative medical interventions, will prove to be nothing less than lifesaving. •  Gallbladder inflammation: I love treating patients with gallbladder inflammation because I have the perfect tool: 88.14 This Yellow, 88.15 Fire Branch and 88.16 Fire All, also known as the Gallbladder Points, along with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7), are outstandingly effective in the treatment of gallbladder disease, inflammation, sludge or stones. Gallstones are easy to treat. In the more than thirty years that I have been in practice, only one of my patients with gallstones has required gallbladder surgery, though nearly all of them were on the surgical schedule when they began treatment with me. People can live with gallstones as long as the gallbladder is not trying to pass them. If I have two weeks to treat the patient, they will keep their gallbladder. In acute cases, I may treat them three times a week with strong needle stimulation and long retention. When the patient is no longer aware of their gallbladder, I usually discontinue needling 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). When they are sixty percent better, treatment frequency may be reduced to once or twice a week. Continue treating the patient until their gallbladder channel is no longer painful when palpated. Dietary advice: Ask the patient to eat handfuls of raw walnuts for prevention and treatment (no salt or sugar). Raw walnuts are good for kidney stones as well. Caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods and oily foods (including dairy) need to be strictly avoided when the gallbladder is inflamed. •  001 Hand Golden Gate: This point came to my attention after I had used the gallbladder protocol described above for more than twenty-five years with exceptional results. I add Hand Golden Gate to this body of work because it was given to us by Dr. Young and is therefore noteworthy, though I have not needled it to relieve cramping gallbladder pain. Please see 001 Hand Golden Gate for further information. •  Alternative treatments for gallbladder pain: •  001 Hand Golden Gate can be added to either 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7) or 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master with 1010.18 Wood Branch. •  Dr. Young gave us the following needle prescription, which can be considered an alternative: 001 Hand Golden Gate, needled with 22.07 Lower White (Xia Bai) and Dan Nang Xue (Extra Point located 1-2.0 cun inferior to GB34 Yang Ling Quan) treats cramping gallbladder pain. •  Bilaterally needle 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) or A.01 Seven Miles (GB32), 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). •  Gallstone pain (formulas): The Gallbladder Points will help with the inflammation and pain from gallstones or grit, but will not remove the stones. To dissolve the stones, long-term use of Li Dan (classic Gallbladder formula) with a tea made from the loose herb Jin Qian Cao (Lysmachia) usually does the trick. •  Other formulas (Dr. Young): Da Chai Hu Tong (Major Bupleurum Decoction) with Jin Qian Cao and Jin Nei Jin. Also, Si Ni San with 3 Mu Xiang, 3 Jin Qian Cao, 3 Zhi Shi, 3 Jin Nei Jin, Da Huang. If the patient has jaundice, use 10 Yun Chen Ho, 1.5 Da Huang, 1.0-1.5 Gan Cao. •  Case history (gallstones): In 1995, I treated a twenty-seven-year-old woman with multiple gallstones. She had extreme gallbladder pain, nausea and vomiting. She was on a surgical schedule to have her gallbladder removed ten days later. She was the only child of two elderly parents in ill health, and had a very stressful job. I had treated her five years previously for PMS and irritability, at her partner’s request. Aside from the severe gallbladder pain, she was in relatively good health. After two treatments using my standard protocol, her gallbladder pain was fifty percent better. After the first week of treatment, she was eighty percent better and cancelled her surgery. We fully restored the functioning of her gallbladder, though she would have needed to continue treatments for some time in order to completely dissolve the gallstones. As is common among patients, once she forgot about her gallbladder and the crisis she had averted, she discontinued treatment. Years later, she called me regarding her mother’s knee pain and expressed her gratitude once again that I had saved her gallbladder. I’m sure she will call me if she needs help again. •  Case history (teen with gallstones): Twenty-seven is young for gallstones, but I actually once had a fourteen-year-old gallbladder patient, and she was the only one who needed her gallbladder removed (and this was because she was too young and too disturbed to be compliant with her treatment). I will never forget Dr. Lee telling me, “Gallstones indicate that something is wrong in the patient’s life, too much worry or the patient is unhappy or has regrets of some kind.” My teenage patient was being raised by her grandparents because both of her parents were addicted to heroin and constantly in and out of rehab. •  Case history (cholecystitis): In 2018, I treated a woman who had cholecystitis and did not have gallstones. Because she was travelling, she gave me three weeks (nine treatments) to resolve her situation. She had constant gallbladder pain, what she called a “bubbling sensation” in her right upper quadrant, temple headaches and substantial nausea every time she ate. During her first treatment, I cupped her neck, shoulders, upper back and toxin areas, because gallbladder obstruction leads to toxin buildup. In all of these areas, the skin was black after cupping. In every treatment, I bilaterally needled 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points along with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). In the fourth treatment (one week later), I cupped the remaining areas of her torso, sacrum and hips, and the skin in these areas was also dark after cupping. By the fifth treatment, she was no longer experiencing any nausea or bubbling sensations, and her gallbladder pain was completely gone. For the sixth treatment, I discontinued needling Wood Branch. When she returned two days later for her seventh treatment, she reported experiencing her gallbladder again, though lightly and intermittently. With her last two treatments, I returned to needling Wood Branch along with the Gallbladder Points. She left with a two-month supply of Li Dan and Jin Qian Cao. Six weeks later, she reported no further gallbladder trouble and has returned to her normal low-fat diet. •  Case history (SAMe40 induced cholecystitis): I had a fifty-year-old patient with extreme pain at REN14. I thought it was either an ulcer or gallstones. Her Liver channel and Gallbladder Points were extremely sensitive. I sent her for an ultrasound, which came back clear. Then she told me that she had been taking SAMe for depression and weight loss. SAMe makes people feel nauseous so they won’t eat as much. Please avoid SAMe and 5HTP because they can cause gallbladder inflammation. I would far rather give my patients Chinese herbs for depression and needle them for weight loss than upset their system in that way. It took six weeks for this patient’s Liver meridian to return to normal. •  TCM wisdom: If the Liver is weak, patients are tired. If the Gallbladder is weak, patients are easily startled. •  Heel or spine pain: “88.16 Fire All can be needled on the opposite side to treat heel or spine pain. This works but the effect does not last long” (Dr. Lee, 1992). ",

See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses for “The microbiome (part two).” •  Ketogenesis and autophagy: Researchers are also recognizing our innate capacity to fuel the brain and body primarily through the metabolism of fat (ketogenesis – the old Atkins Diet model, recently revived), restoring the biological flexibility of our hunter/gatherer ancestors in using both glucose and fat as fuel. When we burn fat as fuel, it allows for a process known as autophagy, the body’s innate ability to rid itself of damaged, toxic, or unused cells. Though humans have always been able to metabolize sugar and fat, most modern brains operate on glucose alone. It has been proven that fat is a much cleaner fuel source without the devastating side effects that have grown out of the sole reliance upon glucose, which is insidious in contemporary cuisines and results in untold inflammation and metabolic syndromes. •  Parasympathetic pathways: All of the detoxification processes occurring within the human body are part of parasympathetic nervous system pathways. This means when the body is engaged in the “fight or flight” response of the sympathetic nervous system, detoxification will never take priority. The chronic, constant stress level of today’s society, a primary cause of our overactive sympathetic systems, must be addressed before – or at least simultaneously with – any other “downstream” interventions. In this regard, Oriental medicine, including Tai Chi, Qi Gong, meditation, acupuncture and herbal medicine, as well as a plethora of other mental, emotional, spiritual, and integrative medical interventions, will prove to be nothing less than lifesaving. •  Gallbladder inflammation: I love treating patients with gallbladder inflammation because I have the perfect tool: 88.14 This Yellow, 88.15 Fire Branch and 88.16 Fire All, also known as the Gallbladder Points, along with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7), are outstandingly effective in the treatment of gallbladder disease, inflammation, sludge or stones. Gallstones are easy to treat. In the more than thirty years that I have been in practice, only one of my patients with gallstones has required gallbladder surgery, though nearly all of them were on the surgical schedule when they began treatment with me. People can live with gallstones as long as the gallbladder is not trying to pass them. If I have two weeks to treat the patient, they will keep their gallbladder. In acute cases, I may treat them three times a week with strong needle stimulation and long retention. When the patient is no longer aware of their gallbladder, I usually discontinue needling 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). When they are sixty percent better, treatment frequency may be reduced to once or twice a week. Continue treating the patient until their gallbladder channel is no longer painful when palpated. Dietary advice: Ask the patient to eat handfuls of raw walnuts for prevention and treatment (no salt or sugar). Raw walnuts are good for kidney stones as well. Caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods and oily foods (including dairy) need to be strictly avoided when the gallbladder is inflamed. •  001 Hand Golden Gate: This point came to my attention after I had used the gallbladder protocol described above for more than twenty-five years with exceptional results. I add Hand Golden Gate to this body of work because it was given to us by Dr. Young and is therefore noteworthy, though I have not needled it to relieve cramping gallbladder pain. Please see 001 Hand Golden Gate for further information. •  Alternative treatments for gallbladder pain: •  001 Hand Golden Gate can be added to either 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7) or 66.03-66.04 Fire Hardness/Fire Master with 1010.18 Wood Branch. •  Dr. Young gave us the following needle prescription, which can be considered an alternative: 001 Hand Golden Gate, needled with 22.07 Lower White (Xia Bai) and Dan Nang Xue (Extra Point located 1-2.0 cun inferior to GB34 Yang Ling Quan) treats cramping gallbladder pain. •  Bilaterally needle 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) or A.01 Seven Miles (GB32), 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). •  Gallstone pain (formulas): The Gallbladder Points will help with the inflammation and pain from gallstones or grit, but will not remove the stones. To dissolve the stones, long-term use of Li Dan (classic Gallbladder formula) with a tea made from the loose herb Jin Qian Cao (Lysmachia) usually does the trick. •  Other formulas (Dr. Young): Da Chai Hu Tong (Major Bupleurum Decoction) with Jin Qian Cao and Jin Nei Jin. Also, Si Ni San with 3 Mu Xiang, 3 Jin Qian Cao, 3 Zhi Shi, 3 Jin Nei Jin, Da Huang. If the patient has jaundice, use 10 Yun Chen Ho, 1.5 Da Huang, 1.0-1.5 Gan Cao.39 •  Case history (gallstones): In 1995, I treated a twenty-seven-year-old woman with multiple gallstones. She had extreme gallbladder pain, nausea and vomiting. She was on a surgical schedule to have her gallbladder removed ten days later. She was the only child of two elderly parents in ill health, and had a very stressful job. I had treated her five years previously for PMS and irritability, at her partner’s request. Aside from the severe gallbladder pain, she was in relatively good health. After two treatments using my standard protocol, her gallbladder pain was fifty percent better. After the first week of treatment, she was eighty percent better and cancelled her surgery. We fully restored the functioning of her gallbladder, though she would have needed to continue treatments for some time in order to completely dissolve the gallstones. As is common among patients, once she forgot about her gallbladder and the crisis she had averted, she discontinued treatment. Years later, she called me regarding her mother’s knee pain and expressed her gratitude once again that I had saved her gallbladder. I’m sure she will call me if she needs help again. •  Case history (teen with gallstones): Twenty-seven is young for gallstones, but I actually once had a fourteen-year-old gallbladder patient, and she was the only one who needed her gallbladder removed (and this was because she was too young and too disturbed to be compliant with her treatment). I will never forget Dr. Lee telling me, “Gallstones indicate that something is wrong in the patient’s life, too much worry or the patient is unhappy or has regrets of some kind.” My teenage patient was being raised by her grandparents because both of her parents were addicted to heroin and constantly in and out of rehab. •  Case history (cholecystitis): In 2018, I treated a woman who had cholecystitis and did not have gallstones. Because she was travelling, she gave me three weeks (nine treatments) to resolve her situation. She had constant gallbladder pain, what she called a “bubbling sensation” in her right upper quadrant, temple headaches and substantial nausea every time she ate. During her first treatment, I cupped her neck, shoulders, upper back and toxin areas, because gallbladder obstruction leads to toxin buildup. In all of these areas, the skin was black after cupping. In every treatment, I bilaterally needled 88.14-88.16 Gallbladder Points along with 1010.18 Wood Branch (ST7). In the fourth treatment (one week later), I cupped the remaining areas of her torso, sacrum and hips, and the skin in these areas was also dark after cupping. By the fifth treatment, she was no longer experiencing any nausea or bubbling sensations, and her gallbladder pain was completely gone. For the sixth treatment, I discontinued needling Wood Branch. When she returned two days later for her seventh treatment, she reported experiencing her gallbladder again, though lightly and intermittently. With her last two treatments, I returned to needling Wood Branch along with the Gallbladder Points. She left with a two-month supply of Li Dan and Jin Qian Cao. Six weeks later, she reported no further gallbladder trouble and has returned to her normal low-fat diet. •  Case history (SAMe40 induced cholecystitis): I had a fifty-year-old patient with extreme pain at REN14. I thought it was either an ulcer or gallstones. Her Liver channel and Gallbladder Points were extremely sensitive. I sent her for an ultrasound, which came back clear. Then she told me that she had been taking SAMe for depression and weight loss. SAMe makes people feel nauseous so they won’t eat as much. Please avoid SAMe and 5HTP because they can cause gallbladder inflammation. I would far rather give my patients Chinese herbs for depression and needle them for weight loss than upset their system in that way. It took six weeks for this patient’s Liver meridian to return to normal. •  TCM wisdom: If the Liver is weak, patients are tired. If the Gallbladder is weak, patients are easily startled. •  Heel or spine pain: “88.16 Fire All can be needled on the opposite side to treat heel or spine pain. This works but the effect does not last long” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

        "techniques": "Needle perpendicularly 0.8 - 2.5 cun . Needle bilaterally, except when treating pain. For pain, needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Dao Ma: The combination of 88.17-88.19 is known as Four Horses. 88.17 Four Horses Middle is the Chief Point and the most powerful point for the Lungs. •  Palpation: Four Horses points are easy to locate because at each point, a depression, small hole or pool of energy can be felt. •  45-degree angle: A reliable approach to locating Four Horses is to identify where the muscles of the thigh change from a horizontal to a vertical plane, on a line originating at the lateral corner of the patella and extending up the thigh. Though the needles are inserted perpendicularly, after insertion they appear to be at a 45-degree angle to the body. Please see inset in point illustration above. •  Bilateral vs. unilateral insertion: Four Horses points are needled bilaterally to treat conditions such as asthma, colds and flus, allergies, thyroid and skin disorders. For conditions located on one side of the body, such as facial paralysis, hemiplegia, sciatica, flank pain, rib pain or breast pain, an opposite-side needling technique may be used. Upper back pain is an indication that may require either bilateral needling or the opposite-side technique. •  Insertion and stimulation: Typically, 88.17 Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is needled first. The other two points are Supplementary Points, located using 88.17 as a reference. After insertion, stimulate Four Horses Middle, and then the outer two points again. •  Needle with qi: For optimal results, please put some qi into your needling. Insert the needle deeply, hold the handle firmly, catch the qi and strongly stimulate these points. I am not suggesting that a patient should experience pain when receiving Four Horses; they should not. But very strong and forceful energy is available here, and you have an opportunity to direct and deliver it. Don’t waste the opportunity! Patients consistently report strong movement of qi in both directions when I needle these points. Downsize your needle gauge to the patient’s comfort level, and then decisively move the qi for immediate and excellent results. These points do not generally bruise, but be sure to avoid any visible blood vessels. •  Needling technique for skin diseases: It is said that skin treats skin and muscle also treats skin. When using Four Horses to treat skin issues, if time allows, insert the needles to the deepest muscle level and strongly stimulate to call the qi. After ten minutes, pull the needles halfway up (to medium depth) and stimulate again. After an additional ten minutes, pull the needles up to the superficial level again, stimulate, and let the patient retain them for the duration of the treatment (30-40 minutes). The technique of calling the qi and then bringing it to the surface is only used in the treatment of skin disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, shingles, acne, or rashes. When needling for acne on the face, start with the most distal point and needle toward the proximal. •  When time is tight: In my clinic, I may bilaterally needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three as soon as I enter the treatment room. Then I talk with the patient and hear their update, and after ten minutes I raise the needles halfway. Just before leaving the room, I pull the needles up to the superficial level. If the clinic is busy and I don’t have time to pull the needles up in stages, instead I insert them to the deep or medium level, stimulate strongly, then pull the energy to the surface level and cover the patient. However, the more gradual method may yield better results, depending on the skill of the practitioner. •  Retention: For constitutional complaints, Four Horses should be needled deeply and retained for a minimum of 45 minutes to be effective. For secondary complaints, a shorter treatment (20 minutes) with opposite-side needling may be utilized. •  Needling depths: The needling depth may range from 0.8 to 2.5 cun. At the most distal point, the needle typically contacts bone; when it does, tap it very gently to avoid injury to the periosteum. To insert to the necessary depth, I use needles of 40-50mm length. If a patient has large thighs, 60mm needles may be required. •  Depth: 0.8-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "My favorite points: The name Four Horses refers to the power of a four-horse carriage moving with extraordinary momentum. A one-horse carriage ride through the countryside on a lazy Sunday afternoon would not be a fitting metaphor for the strong and lasting effects of these amazing points. This three- or six-point pattern is easy to locate and very versatile. These points are prized by Tung’s acupuncture practitioners for their use in treating a wide and diverse array of disorders, especially lung diseases, including: impaired breathing and asthma, skin conditions, rhinitis, tuberculosis, rib pain, upper back pain, thyroid problems, and sciatica or lower back pain due to Lung deficiency. These points are extremely effective for pain related to Lung deficiency, especially when there is excess fatigue; for that reason, they are also primary points for fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. I love these points and use them more frequently in my practice than any other Dao Ma pattern. •  A.04 San Cha Three: Nearly every time I needle Four Horses, I add A.04 San Cha Three (needled toward HT8 Shao Fu), as they complement each other perfectly. This combination is my first choice for colds and flus, but it is also an excellent choice for skin conditions, allergies (seasonal or otherwise), and immune system weakness. (See A.04 San Cha Three.) •  The microbiome (part two): Our bodies are throwbacks to the era of hunters and gatherers, but since those times our diet and environment have radically changed. Because of our consumption of animals that are factory raised on GMO corn, steroids, and antibiotics, and also because many people ingest large quantities of sugar, caffeine, drugs or alcohol daily, we have created a world of suffering for ourselves and other beings. We are witnessing an unprecedented rise in autoimmune diseases, diabetes, autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and a host of other man-made calamities. Using the technology developed during the Human Genome Project (2003), scientists have newly discovered the human microbiome and the fact that we are composed of 50-100 trillion organisms that are non-human. These organisms that we host are sometimes working in harmony with us as a healthy microbiome, and thus constitute the majority of our immune system. However, in more recent history this relationship has become less harmonious due to the creation of a pathological biofilm, the overuse of antibiotics, poor diets, toxic chemical and environmental exposures, and a more or less sedentary, feasting lifestyle. The good news is that we are beginning to understand that we have been missing a very crucial piece of information, recently revealed by “The Microbiome Project.” Our microbiome is heavily influenced by our environment – what is around us. Chronic disease is the interaction between our environment and our genetic triggers; thus, the triggers alone are not a death sentence, and they may never genetically express, but for our choices and environments. Sadly, researchers have found that chronic disease processes begin in utero, as babies’ umbilical cords are loaded with more than two hundred and eighty known toxins, such as BPA (bisphenol A) and glyphosate, which poison our developing children before they even enter the world. This reality is sad and horrifying, and my only intention in sharing it is to awaken you to the real danger. We are not going to wake up in our world and discover all of the remarkable things that we did while we were sleeping; rather, we must awaken and take responsibility for the mess that we have created, and do everything in our power to clean it up immediately. The planet and future generations depend upon our conscious actions. It is absolutely crucial to understand that we control our fate. We must recover our leaky guts and immune systems by rebuilding our microbiome through cleansing and detoxing our bodies. Very simply, this means that if you choose to eat organic foods, that choice alone will lead you to feel better. Stop compromising! The unhealthy gut microbiome produces bioactive compounds that powerfully influence the central nervous system (CNS), creating unhealthy cravings that are difficult to ignore. Is it YOU who wants another candy bar, pastry and espresso, salted fries or bowl of pasta, or is it the bugs inside of you? For those of us who are health practitioners, awareness of these phenomena can help us educate and treat our patients. Patients need to fully understand what made them so sick before they will agree to do what they need to do to get well. They must understand that there will be a die-off of “bad” microbes before the healthy new ones can take over, and that detoxing can take time – sometimes more than a year or two. Dietary restrictions have to be spelled out clearly if patients are going to be successful in their healing. Children who were placed on round after round of antibiotics, seemingly from birth, have immune systems that are totally compromised. These children with hypersensitivities are unable to withstand the world as it is. We see this in their eating habits, health issues and emotional behaviors. I fear for their future, and ours as well. It would be interesting to study what such a child would be like if they were fed a healthy, chemical-free diet and protected from electromagnetic field smog and stray electricity. It is my belief that even autistic children would flourish in such an environment and likely become the prodigies of the future. Changing to an entirely clean diet may seem utterly overwhelming to families with poor eating habits (80% of Americans). If we propose permanent dietary changes as restrictive as the complete avoidance of all trans fats, sugars, flours, grains, and processed foods of any kind (in other words, inflammatory foods), parents freak out. Instead, it is better to suggest that they start with a short period of time – three months – to restrict their child’s diet. However, they will find that the changes in the child’s physical, mental and emotional health and their unmanageable behaviors will radically change within less than two weeks, after which the dietary restrictions will be viewed as a real godsend and will be easy to maintain. Parents of young children may have to use bribes (e.g., toys) to introduce healthier eating habits. In the beginning, tantrums and meltdowns are to be expected. It takes three days to break an addiction, so usually within four days, the child is hungry enough and willing to try new foods like leafy greens if they are prepared in a tasty manner. Get some nutritional counseling and get started. Honestly, the health of your child, your family, your community and our earth ALL begin here. We must take responsibility for what we put into our bodies and understand the dangers of factory farming, including chemicals introduced into the soil, water, air and food that we consume. In the 1960s, people were alarmed by the effects of DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), but now the primary chemical culprit is glyphosate. The chemical breakdown of glyphosate is AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid). When testing the environment or the blood for glyphosate poisoning, we must test for both glyphosate and AMPA to understand the seriousness of these and other toxic chemicals, which are now found worldwide, even in the rain. It is only through grassroots movements that the use of GMOs, harmful chemicals and factory farming will change. It is entirely up to us. Read labels, buy organic, and avoid plastics, and you will be on your way to a healthier future for your family and generations to come. Stop using antibacterial hand sanitizer and get some dirt under your fingernails. Touch the earth and let her touch you. In Chinese medicine, we think about the earth element when it comes to providing nutrients for the whole body and keeping the immune system vital and strong. Hippocrates said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” I would contend that Chinese medicine said this first. Please see 88.15-88.16 Fire Branch/Fire All for “The microbiome (part one).” •  When I think of Four Horses, I think “immune system:” Four Horses are used to address all kinds of immune system reactions, from common cold and allergies to something as rare as the autoimmune disease known as pemphigoid/pemphigus. Allergic reactions usually involve some kind of trigger that pushes the liver beyond its capacity to detoxify the system when the Lung and Spleen are weak, and immunity is compromised. Four Horses have the Reaction Areas of the Lung and Liver. The Lung governs the surface (or Wei qi) and the Liver cleans the blood. When the Wei qi is weak, the body is vulnerable to external wind; when the Liver is weak, the blood is not clean and internal wind results. Found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses relate to both wind and phlegm. Their extraordinary power comes from their ability to strengthen both the Lung and Liver through boosting the Spleen, cleaning the blood and expelling wind. •  Energetic pathways: Below is an explanation of the many different ways in which the energetics of Four Horses combine. We have done our best to tease out these relationships in a linear way in order that they might be more easily understood; however, they layer one upon another and are inextricably interwoven, interrelated, and not necessarily presented in order of importance. Their many overlapping energetic interactions make Four Horses extremely clinically useful: Spleen/Stomach: The Spleen governs the muscles, and together with the Stomach, it is responsible for postnatal qi. Four Horses points are located near the Stomach channel in the large quadriceps muscles of the thigh. Due to the abundant nerve and blood supply found there, needling these points provides ample tonification of qi and blood. Because of this earth element relationship, these points not only have a powerful influence over the immune system, but also are helpful in treating phlegm conditions such as hypothyroid and/or goiter. Muscle treats muscle, which enables us to use these points to treat muscle weakness or atrophy, multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Because Four Horses points regulate the Spleen and Stomach, and the Stomach channel travels to the face, they are also used to treat diseases of the eyes, ears, nose and throat. •  Lung/Spleen: The Lung governs the Wei qi, which is responsible for the surface of the body and prevents the invasion of external pathogens. Because of the relationship of the Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP), Four Horses points tonify both Lung and Spleen qi. This makes them highly useful in the treatment of any kind of immune system deficiency, including autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, cough, colds or flus, phlegm, and skin diseases. The Spleen governs the muscles, and muscle treats muscle, but muscle also treats the skin. In most cases of Spleen deficiency, we see not only signs of internal dampness but also damp skin diseases, muscle weakness, loose stools and fatigue. •  Lung/Large Intenstine: In addition to the above relationships, Tai Yin and Yang Ming are connected through the internal/external relationship of the Lung and Large Intestine, and both have a strong influence over external wind. We frequently add LI20 Welcome Fragrance as a Guiding Point for issues on the face, such as acne, but it is especially good for sinus infections or inflammation, sinus headaches, as well as other nasal problems, such as polyps or atrophy. Nasal atrophy is the loss of the ability to smell and therefore also taste. It frequently occurs after surgery as a side effect to anesthesia but also may be related to other kinds of drug interactions. See 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) for my unique and detailed needling instructions. •  Large Intestine/Liver: In Tung’s acupuncture, we recognize a special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and Foot Jue Yin (LV), which work together to detoxify the body. While the Large Intestine and Lungs are closely related (the Large Intestine expels toxins through the bowels, the Lungs through the skin), the Liver detoxifies the entire body by filtering the blood. Both the Liver and the Large Intestine expel wind – the Liver internally, and the Large Intestine externally. Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is located anterior to GB31 Wind Market, so Four Horses is associated with all kinds of wind diseases due to the internal/ external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder (wood and wind), making Four Horses very useful in the treatment of dizziness, vertigo, Meniere’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and hyperthyroidism. •  Lung/Liver: Four Horses points have the Reaction Areas of Lung and Liver; while the Lung governs the surface, the Liver cleans the blood. As previously discussed, one of the most common indications of a compromised immune system is an allergic skin reaction that happens when the surface is weak and the liver is overworked. Because Four Horses can be used to expel wind and move the blood, it is especially useful in treating allergic reactions that cause itching, rashes, psoriasis, eczema or fungal infections. Lung/Urinary Bladder: The Chinese have a saying: “The wind chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Never is this more evident than in situations of wind chill lodging in the neck and upper back, causing not only muscle spasm but also the onset of most common colds and flu. There is a special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB), characterized in part by the ability of both to disperse fluids. When the evil wind chill penetrates the Wei qi, governed by the Lungs, we use surface-dispersing herbs to open the exterior and induce sweating, thus relieving the Tai Yang upper back. The Tai Yin/Tai Yang relationship is also evident in the use of Four Horses for thorax pain (front or back), chest and rib pain, as well as Lung-deficient-type UB channel sciatica. However, I rarely use Four Horses for sciatica unless the patient also has another condition such as asthma, allergies or psoriasis, for which Four Horses points are indicated. •  Cough and asthma: Four Horses are my primary points and favorites for asthma and pneumonia, but they are also very good for any kind of cough, whether it is acute or chronic. If the wind chill has lodged in the upper back muscles, or if the lungs feel heavy or tight, cup the entire neck and upper back (with the patient sitting upright), then needle Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/ Water Through. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) bilaterally is especially helpful in severe cases; it will open the lungs and immediately calm the breathing. If you are not comfortable bleeding LU5, it could be bilaterally needled. Water Gold/Water Through points tonify the Lungs and Kidneys and are great when a patient has been coughing or wheezing for an extended period of time. Because Water Gold/Water Through points are used for lower back pain and sexual dysfunction, they also can treat urinary incontinence that may arise toward the end of a severe upper respiratory infection. If the patient is experiencing allergic asthma, I am also likely to add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) to open the sinuses. •  Common cold: Illness may be avoided altogether if, within a few hours of being chilled, the patient takes an extremely hot shower with water beating upon the upper back and neck. This corresponds with the Chinese teaching, “The wind-chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Often patients feel a shudder of cold coming out through the surface while they stand under the steaming hot water. They need to be careful not to get exposed to another chill after the hot shower (bring warm clothes into the bathroom). A good sweat, followed by a change of clothes, should relieve the chill. Treatments: •  Cupping: When a patient has a wind-chill invasion, I immediately cup their entire upper back to remove it. This must be done within a few hours of the exposure for best results, although it may still be appropriate days later if the chill is still lodged in the body. •  Cold/flu, sinusitis, allergies: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as Guiding Points; optional 11.17 Wood (Anger). •  Optional: Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment: Bilaterally needle ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7 in this order, tonifying the bottom and sedating the top), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20). For headache from a common cold: Unilaterally needle 22.04 Da Bai and A.04 San Cha Three (one point on each side). •  For sore throat: Bleed VT.01 Throat Nine Moths or bleed LU11 and LI1. •  To clear the sinuses: Needle 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) toward Yin Tang. •  Optional: To open the nose: Bilaterally needle proximal point 11.17 Wood (Anger). For nasal blockage with pain or headache: Unilaterally needle 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43). •  Allergy option: Needle 11.17 Wood (Anger), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20), LI4/LV3 Four Gates or 22.04 Da Bai. •  For ear pain: Bleed 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles. •  Hyperthyroid: Four Horses points emphasize the relationship between wood and metal, as well as that of qi and blood. They treat conjunctivitis and hyperthyroid, both of which have a relationship to the Liver. According to TCM, simple goiter is phlegm accumulation in the neck, caused by qi and blood stagnation. Usually a strong emotional component is involved, and if irritability and frustration are also present, the condition may easily transform into Spleen qi (phlegm) obstruction with Liver qi stagnation. This causes Liver fire to rise, resulting in Heart yin deficiency and potentially hyperthyroidism. Because Four Horses points are located between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, they are capable of addressing both wind and phlegm in a powerful way. Due to the relationships between San Jiao and Gallbladder, Gallbladder and Liver, and Spleen and Stomach, and their passage through the neck, where the thyroid gland is located, Four Horses becomes one of the best point patterns in the treatment of hyperthyroid disease, including enlarged thyroid, goiter, and/or related protrusion of the eyeballs. •  Skin diseases: Similar in function to LI11 Qu Chi and 44.06 Shoulder Center (also located in large muscles), Four Horses points treat the skin because needling muscle treats muscle and also treats the skin (Dr. Young, 2008). Skin diseases are more common in places where people eat rich foods, are exposed to environmental toxins, raise pets, etc. Four Horses are fabulous points for the skin – for itching, pruritis, acne, shingles, psoriasis, eczema, and skin fungus as well as thickening of the skin or scleroderma. I have found them to be extraordinary in the treatment of psoriasis (although dietary changes are also essential). If the skin disorder is severe, bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex once a week, because Shao Yang (SJ/GB) governs wind, and Tai Yang (SI/UB) governs the exterior and the skin; both Shao Yang and Tai Yang travel to the back of the ear. See Needling Notes above for further instructions related to the treatment of skin diseases. •  Acne: Four Horses is excellent for treating acne. Nine out of ten patients with acne have a red face. With Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three, the patient’s face becomes less red, their skin improves, and the acne goes away. Over time, even the scars from acne may disappear. Add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as a Guiding Point and treat 1-3 times weekly. Herbs and dietary restrictions are helpful. •  Itching and rashes: Itching and rashes are wind disorders that happen when qi, blood, wind and fire are fighting. With wind disorders, we must disperse wind, and vitalize and clean the blood. Though invaluable for itching and rashes, Four Horses can be rotated with the primary meridian points, SP6 San Yin Jiao, SP10 Xue Hai, LI11 Qu Chi, Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point) and HT8 Shao Fu (as A.04 San Cha Three). •  SP6 San Yin Jiao strengthens the Spleen and eliminates dampness. •  SP10 Xue Hai cools the blood and removes dampness to stop itching. •  LI11 Qu Chi clears heat, cools the blood, expels wind and alleviates itching. •  Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point), Hundred Insect Burrow, is located 1.0 cun proximal to SP10 and is used to relieve itching and soothe the skin. •  HT8 Shao Fu (which is reached via A.04 San Cha Three) is very good for itching because itching and pain belong to the Heart. As a Ying-Spring and fire point, HT8 disperses heat and treats changes in face color (not due to emotions). •  Psoriasis: I have successfully treated countless cases of psoriasis using Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three. As long as the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas (also known as Poison Points) are free of psoriasis, I thoroughly cup them weekly, until no color appears. For the quickest results, ask the patient to avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, dairy, wheat, sugar and albumin (egg whites). Eating egg yolks may reduce itching. Some patients are unable to follow these extreme dietary restrictions; however, in severe cases I will not treat them unless they are willing to comply. It is important that psoriasis patients wear only cotton next to their skin, and stay off of synthetic carpets, AstroTurf, and any other kind of chemical irritant. •  Case history: I first treated a patient with severe psoriasis in 1988. He was Filipino, so his natural skin color was brown; however, he had psoriatic lesions from head to toe, making his skin appear pink and white. His joints were also affected, swollen and inflamed from advanced psoriasis. I treated him using Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, dietary restrictions and a strong herbal formula. I advised him to take daily “sun baths” in the nude because sunshine is helpful in healing this kind of skin disease. Within three months, the pink and white lesions had turned to a light tan color and no longer looked crusted or inflamed. I then was able to cup the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. Within six months, his skin fully recovered, his joints were no longer painful, and he was able to discontinue treatment, maintaining his new healthy diet. •  Case history: A fifty-year-old real estate agent came to see me because of severe psoriasis on his hands. He also had large patches all over his body, but he was less concerned about those, as in his line of work it was necessary that he shake people’s hands. It was always awkward for him when clients saw his hands then withdrew their own. I discussed with him the parameters of treating severe psoriasis (outlined above) and told him that if he was unable to follow the dietary restrictions, I would be unable to help him. This man was addicted to caffeinated energy drinks and enjoyed one or two cocktails every evening. He agreed to the restrictions. After three months, with two or three treatments per week, he was 90% better. He was no longer afraid to offer a handshake. •  Case history: A sixty-year-old woman came to see me for a tangerine-sized patch of psoriasis on the back of her neck. It was dark red, solid and inflamed. It had appeared when she was fifteen years old. She also had psoriasis in and behind her ears and around her anterior hairline. I put her on the usual dietary restrictions and herbs for skin and hot flashes. She could only see me once a month because she lived four hours away. I thoroughly cupped her upper back and DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and seven-star-hammered the healthy skin surrounding the lesion on the back of her neck. I then needled Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. Now, one year later, the lesion on her neck is entirely gone and she has mostly returned to her normal diet. Because she occasionally has one or two tiny spots of psoriasis within her hairline and in or behind her ears, she continues to take her herbal formula at a 25% dose and returns periodically for a maintenance treatment. I recently asked her to topically apply diluted tea tree oil on those areas and to do a better job of drying her ears after showering. •  Case history: A forty-year-old patient, whom I originally saw when she was in her thirties for asthma, returned four years ago with psoriasis on her hands and feet. The psoriasis on her feet was cracked and bleeding, and it prevented her from wearing shoes. She swam regularly in a chlorinated pool. Along with wearing sandals, swimming had caused her skin to suffer from exposure to chlorine, wind and sun, drying it even further. In order to treat this patient, I had to ask her to discontinue swimming until her skin had healed. This and the dietary restrictions were very challenging for her, but she complied. Within six weeks, her skin had improved by eighty percent and she was able to wear her regular shoes. She returned to swimming and maintained her dietary restrictions. After approximately eighteen months of intermittent treatment, I ran an allergy blood panel to determine which foods might cause her immune system to react. We were delighted to find that she had successfully turned off all of her triggers. When I called to give her the results of her blood test and to tell her that she might begin to include some of the foods she had been avoiding, she informed me that she had begun a Weight Watchers program and had already been including small amounts of the forbidden foods for over six months without any exacerbation of her psoriasis, but even more importantly, without triggering an immune reaction. It can be done! •  Case history (scleroderma): A forty-five-year-old man with scleroderma who lived three and a half hours away was referred to my office by an acupuncturist who was leaving his area. The patient had been suffering from scleroderma his entire adult life, with very large areas of scarring on the right side of his back, arm, leg, lateral ankle and foot. It had started in the ankle, so this area was the worst; it was entirely scarred, rigid and devoid of any pigment color. Areas of pigment loss and scarring created a pulling sensation though his right armpit down to his wrist. There was an area of scarring on his right scapula that pulled into his right neck and shoulder areas. Another painful area on his right flank caused a pulling sensation down the entire IT41 band of his right leg, exacerbating the severe disability in his ankle. I began his treatment by cupping all of the affected areas except the ankle, to which I applied warming oil and a heat lamp. The cupping gave him enormous relief; he even shaved his armpit before each treatment so I could apply cups there. The cupping in the armpit and down the medial arm was excruciatingly painful, but the subsequent relief from the pulling sensation of the scleroderma was worth it to him and lasted nearly the entire month between his treatments. He was unable to take herbs but followed the anti-inflammatory diet that I prescribed. His treatments included a full hour of cupping every visit, followed by Four Horses and San Cha Three. I treated him for two years, during which time his skin discontinued coloring after cupping, his scleroderma improved by 70%, and he began a full-time job that precluded him from continuing treatment. •  Tinnitus: Low-pitch tinnitus is most frequently thought of as a Kidney-deficient condition. It tends to get worse when the patient is tired, and it may even stop once in a while. Tinnitus can be difficult to treat, and Kidney tonification does not always help. For these patients, it may be more effective to tonify Spleen qi and yang using Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three and 22.05 Ling Gu. SI3 Hou Xi and/or SI19 Ting Gong may also be helpful. •  Scalp acupuncture: For very stubborn tinnitus, you can thread three needles vertically toward the ear (beginning 1.0 cun above the ear, needle three points, one in the center and two 0.5 cun to either side). This area is known in scalp acupuncture as the “area of hearing and understanding language.” It is very painful to needle because there are multiple blood vessels in this area, so downsize your needle gauge (I use Seirin 00/0.12mm x 30mm needles with dark green handles). •  Guiding Points: SI19 Ting Gong with SJ21 Er Men or SJ22 Er He Liao can be needled on the same side as Guiding Points. •  Tinnitus in TCM: Interesting information is found in Applied Channel Theory in Chinese Medicine by Dr. Wang Ju-Yi and Jason Robertson (2008): “The relationship of the Kidney to the ears is often misunderstood and sometimes leads to ineffective clinical treatment. Classical references should be placed in the context of the Kidney’s relationship to growth, development and decline through the stages of life. In short, the Kidney is most often related to hearing problems in the elderly, when the Kidney essence is thought to wane … generally this is low-pitched tinnitus that is often worse in the afternoon or when the patient is tired. Note: Excess type tinnitus is high-pitched and often more acute ... it often involves problems with dampness or heat in the fluids of the ear. Use points on the Shao Yang meridian to dredge and drain.” •  Formulas (Dr. Young): The classic formula Yi Qi Cong Ming Tong is very useful in the treatment of tinnitus and consists of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tong with Man Jing Zi, Ge Gen, Dang Shen and Sheng Ma. In China, doctors inject Ge Gen at SI19 to treat tinnitus. •  Other ear disorders: For ear pain, otitis media, hearing loss or sudden deafness, Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three may be useful due to the Hand and Foot Shao Yang relationship. Other options might include bleeding the small veins surrounding the outside ankle between the lateral malleoli and GB39, bleeding 11.26 Control Dirt or bleeding LU5. For sudden hearing loss, we might include bilateral needling of 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors. Bleeding 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU16) or needling the three points anterior to the ear (GB2, SI19, SJ21) might also be useful in these cases. For treating otitis media, usually I choose 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles and A.04 San Cha Three on the side opposite the indications, with same-side 22.06 Zhong Bai or SI3 Hou Xi as a Guiding Point. •  Red sclera: Because the Lungs govern the sclera, Four Horses can also treat eyes that are red due to Lung heat. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) or 99.08 Ear Apex is also an outstanding way to clear the eyes. Four Horses includes the specific indication of conjunctivitis. •  Fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and muscle atrophy: We needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three because of the muscle-treating-muscle principle, and because the Spleen governs muscles. Located very near the Stomach channel, in the large quadriceps muscles that have significant nerve and blood supplies, these points tonify Spleen qi, adjust the Spleen and Stomach, and can be very effective in the treatment of muscle weakness, fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. For the same reasons, you might also choose these points for hemiplegia, facial paralysis or spasm. •  Fibromyalgia: This condition is characterized by hypersensitivity of nerve endings. Because of this, if the patient is needle phobic, it is important to downsize needle gauge (I may use dark green handled Seirin needles 00/0.12mm). Cupping may be helpful for particularly inflamed muscles. However, three pumps are necessary to keep the suction on a cup, and that may be excruciating for the patient, so apply one small cup at a time. Liver stagnation causes fibromyalgia, which is especially exacerbated by stress. Treatment is directed toward soothing the Liver and opening stagnation, using LI4/LV3 Four Gates with GB41 Ling Qi and A.04 San Cha Three for whole-body pain. 66.07 Mu Liu can be added to regulate the Liver and tonify earth. 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three is another good treatment option. For fibromyalgia, my favorite formula by far is Xiao Yao Wan, with modifications. •  Multiple sclerosis: One way to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) is with IgG and IgA reactivity screening for myelin basic protein. If these counts are elevated, it is a likely indication of demyelination of the myelin sheath, which protects and insulates the nerve fibers surrounding the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. MS can be temporary or permanent, depending upon the severity and location of the scars that interrupt nerve impulses to the brain. Early signs include heaviness, numbness, tingling and/or electrical sensations in the hands or legs. TCM recognizes a few typical patterns, made obvious through following the signs and symptoms. Spleen dampness is a common cause of circulatory obstruction, especially when combined with any kind of dampness in the external environment. Poor habits that weaken the power of the Liver and Kidneys are frequently seen, causing poor circulation and weakness in the legs, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision or urinary incontinence, to name a few symptoms. By far the best prevention is a good diet that includes organic foods and excludes caffeine, alcohol, trans fats, cold foods, dairy products and genetically modified foods. Also, proper exercise, sleep and rest are essential in returning MS patients to full health. Following are suggestions for treating MS with Tung’s acupuncture: •  Treatment: The basic principle is to tonify the Spleen and Kidneys, detoxify the liver and brain, and strengthen nerves, tendons and muscles. Treatment should focus on 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors with GB34 Yang Ling Quan, or 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three. If it is difficult for the patient to extend their muscles, add 22.05 Ling Gu and 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3). If there is numbness, add 77.05-77.07 Three Weights with 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to wake up the brain and circulate the blood. Though individual herbs must be prescribed, Shao Yao Gan Cao plus Ge Gen is useful in softening tense or hard muscles; it will cause a soft stool, so it should be used to bowel tolerance. People with a damp Spleen may have a soft stool already; however, constipation can also be an issue when nerve conduction is sufficiently interrupted. •  Afterbirth wind (Dr. Lee): “In particular, I like to use Four Horses for the treatment of post-partum invasion of external cold, causing joint pain. Since these points are on the Stomach channel, they treat a wide range of diseases, especially those having to do with the Heart” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Thoracic pain: Four Horses is very effective for breast pain and chest pain, including chest pain due to injury, especially if the pain moves from the front to the sides. Because the points are found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses treats breast and chest pain related to Yang Ming, but also treats pain that migrates to the side, relating to Shao Yang. Due to the Shao Yang connection, these points can be used bilaterally or unilaterally, for opposite-side pain of the upper back, chest, abdomen, rib, and intercostal or flank pain. Opposite-side needling is appropriate for hemiplegia, especially if there are also Lung or Liver conditions. •  Breast cancer: For breast cancer, needle 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop and bleed Four Horses (Dr. Young).",

If severe, bleed DU14, UB13, UB15 to clear heat; the patient should eat less sugar, especially chocolate, and no oily or spicy foods. The patient should eat more fruit and vegetables, wash the face often, avoid staying out late, and avoid sunlight because the heat worsens acne. Daily bowel movements are important to remove toxins from the blood. •  Itching and rashes: Cup DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas; bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses (see Needling Notes); sedate LI11 Qu Chi and SP10 Xue Hai; Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point). •  Neck rashes: Needle bilaterally or on the side opposite the indications: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 44.06 Shoulder Center; bleed 99.08 Ear Apex. •  Urticaria (hives): Cup the navel; bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex; bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three; optionally add 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31). The patient should avoid consuming egg whites. •  Shingles: Bleed 99.08 Ear Apex, bleed 11.26 Control Dirt, bleed 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40); bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses. For post-herpetic pain, to release the virus from the nerve endings, seven-star hammer (never before the scabs have fallen off). •  Rib pain that has moved from the chest to the sides: Needle bilaterally or on the opposite side: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), GB34 Yang Ling Quan. •  Intercostal pain: Needle opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, with 66.09 Water Curve (GB41) on the same side as the pain. •  Back pain on both sides: Bleed UB40 Wei Zhong (any vein in the popliteal crease); bilaterally needle SI3 Hou Xi with UB65 Shu Gu; 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with 22.01 Double Child, 88.11 Passing Back, 77.04 Catching Ball (Tung’s UB57). •  Fibromyalgia: See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Comments. •  Multiple sclerosis: See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Comments. •  Leg numbness: To tonify qi, bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with bilateral or opposite-side 44.06 Shoulder Center. •  Hyperthyroid: For shaky, nervous, sweating, hungry wind disease, open the Four Gates (LI4/LV3) to soothe the Liver: bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with 88.12 Bright Yellow; 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows with 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31); bilaterally needle or bleed 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold. •  Goiter: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; bilaterally needle or bleed 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold. •  Deviation of the mouth: Bleed 77.07 Third Weight; needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 88.09 Passing Kidney (Dr. Young). •  Facial twitch: Needle bilaterally or on the opposite side: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles, 22.04 Da Bai, SI3 Hou Xi. Opposite-side treatments are usually applied, unless the problem is chronic. I have found the formula Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin to be enormously helpful, with symptoms abating within two or three doses; however, the patient should continue taking the herbs for at least 4-5 days. They should avoid caffeine and alcohol. •  Chest or abdominal pain: Needle opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; unilaterally needle 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4), PC6 Nei Guan. For abdominal pain, needle SP4 first, followed by PC6. For chest pain, needle PC6 first to direct the treatment to the chest, followed by SP4. •  Lateral lower abdominal pain (between ST and GB channels): Needle 22.05 Ling Gu; SJ5 Wai Guan; PC6 Nei Guan; 88.17-88.19 Four Horses. Though any of the previous points might be used, I am unlikely to employ them. I would choose opposite-side 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43), with unilateral 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) and PC6 Nei Guan. •  Breast cancer: Needle 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop; bleed 88.17-88.19 Four Horses (Dr. Young), but only if you see good blood vessels in this area. •  Conjunctivitis: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; bleed same-side 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex or Tai Yang (Extra Point). •  Heel pain: Needle bilateral or opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Hand Heel Points (PC7 and one additional point 1.0 cun distal)",

        "techniques": "Needle perpendicularly 0.8 - 2.5 cun . Needle bilaterally, except when treating pain. For pain, needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Dao Ma: The combination of 88.17-88.19 is known as Four Horses. 88.17 Four Horses Middle is the Chief Point and the most powerful point for the Lungs. •  Palpation: Four Horses points are easy to locate because at each point, a depression, small hole or pool of energy can be felt. •  45-degree angle: A reliable approach to locating Four Horses is to identify where the muscles of the thigh change from a horizontal to a vertical plane, on a line originating at the lateral corner of the patella and extending up the thigh. Though the needles are inserted perpendicularly, after insertion they appear to be at a 45-degree angle to the body. Please see inset in point illustration above. •  Bilateral vs. unilateral insertion: Four Horses points are needled bilaterally to treat conditions such as asthma, colds and flus, allergies, thyroid and skin disorders. For conditions located on one side of the body, such as facial paralysis, hemiplegia, sciatica, flank pain, rib pain or breast pain, an opposite-side needling technique may be used. Upper back pain is an indication that may require either bilateral needling or the opposite-side technique. •  Insertion and stimulation: Typically, 88.17 Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is needled first. The other two points are Supplementary Points, located using 88.17 as a reference. After insertion, stimulate Four Horses Middle, and then the outer two points again. •  Needle with qi: For optimal results, please put some qi into your needling. Insert the needle deeply, hold the handle firmly, catch the qi and strongly stimulate these points. I am not suggesting that a patient should experience pain when receiving Four Horses; they should not. But very strong and forceful energy is available here, and you have an opportunity to direct and deliver it. Don’t waste the opportunity! Patients consistently report strong movement of qi in both directions when I needle these points. Downsize your needle gauge to the patient’s comfort level, and then decisively move the qi for immediate and excellent results. These points do not generally bruise, but be sure to avoid any visible blood vessels. •  Needling technique for skin diseases: It is said that skin treats skin and muscle also treats skin. When using Four Horses to treat skin issues, if time allows, insert the needles to the deepest muscle level and strongly stimulate to call the qi. After ten minutes, pull the needles halfway up (to medium depth) and stimulate again. After an additional ten minutes, pull the needles up to the superficial level again, stimulate, and let the patient retain them for the duration of the treatment (30-40 minutes). The technique of calling the qi and then bringing it to the surface is only used in the treatment of skin disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, shingles, acne, or rashes. When needling for acne on the face, start with the most distal point and needle toward the proximal. •  When time is tight: In my clinic, I may bilaterally needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three as soon as I enter the treatment room. Then I talk with the patient and hear their update, and after ten minutes I raise the needles halfway. Just before leaving the room, I pull the needles up to the superficial level. If the clinic is busy and I don’t have time to pull the needles up in stages, instead I insert them to the deep or medium level, stimulate strongly, then pull the energy to the surface level and cover the patient. However, the more gradual method may yield better results, depending on the skill of the practitioner. •  Retention: For constitutional complaints, Four Horses should be needled deeply and retained for a minimum of 45 minutes to be effective. For secondary complaints, a shorter treatment (20 minutes) with opposite-side needling may be utilized. •  Needling depths: The needling depth may range from 0.8 to 2.5 cun. At the most distal point, the needle typically contacts bone; when it does, tap it very gently to avoid injury to the periosteum. To insert to the necessary depth, I use needles of 40-50mm length. If a patient has large thighs, 60mm needles may be required. •  Depth: 0.8-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "My favorite points: The name Four Horses refers to the power of a four-horse carriage moving with extraordinary momentum. A one-horse carriage ride through the countryside on a lazy Sunday afternoon would not be a fitting metaphor for the strong and lasting effects of these amazing points. This three- or six-point pattern is easy to locate and very versatile. These points are prized by Tung’s acupuncture practitioners for their use in treating a wide and diverse array of disorders, especially lung diseases, including: impaired breathing and asthma, skin conditions, rhinitis, tuberculosis, rib pain, upper back pain, thyroid problems, and sciatica or lower back pain due to Lung deficiency. These points are extremely effective for pain related to Lung deficiency, especially when there is excess fatigue; for that reason, they are also primary points for fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. I love these points and use them more frequently in my practice than any other Dao Ma pattern. •  A.04 San Cha Three: Nearly every time I needle Four Horses, I add A.04 San Cha Three (needled toward HT8 Shao Fu), as they complement each other perfectly. This combination is my first choice for colds and flus, but it is also an excellent choice for skin conditions, allergies (seasonal or otherwise), and immune system weakness. (See A.04 San Cha Three.) •  The microbiome (part two): Our bodies are throwbacks to the era of hunters and gatherers, but since those times our diet and environment have radically changed. Because of our consumption of animals that are factory raised on GMO corn, steroids, and antibiotics, and also because many people ingest large quantities of sugar, caffeine, drugs or alcohol daily, we have created a world of suffering for ourselves and other beings. We are witnessing an unprecedented rise in autoimmune diseases, diabetes, autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and a host of other man-made calamities. Using the technology developed during the Human Genome Project (2003), scientists have newly discovered the human microbiome and the fact that we are composed of 50-100 trillion organisms that are non-human. These organisms that we host are sometimes working in harmony with us as a healthy microbiome, and thus constitute the majority of our immune system. However, in more recent history this relationship has become less harmonious due to the creation of a pathological biofilm, the overuse of antibiotics, poor diets, toxic chemical and environmental exposures, and a more or less sedentary, feasting lifestyle. The good news is that we are beginning to understand that we have been missing a very crucial piece of information, recently revealed by “The Microbiome Project.” Our microbiome is heavily influenced by our environment – what is around us. Chronic disease is the interaction between our environment and our genetic triggers; thus, the triggers alone are not a death sentence, and they may never genetically express, but for our choices and environments. Sadly, researchers have found that chronic disease processes begin in utero, as babies’ umbilical cords are loaded with more than two hundred and eighty known toxins, such as BPA (bisphenol A) and glyphosate, which poison our developing children before they even enter the world. This reality is sad and horrifying, and my only intention in sharing it is to awaken you to the real danger. We are not going to wake up in our world and discover all of the remarkable things that we did while we were sleeping; rather, we must awaken and take responsibility for the mess that we have created, and do everything in our power to clean it up immediately. The planet and future generations depend upon our conscious actions. It is absolutely crucial to understand that we control our fate. We must recover our leaky guts and immune systems by rebuilding our microbiome through cleansing and detoxing our bodies. Very simply, this means that if you choose to eat organic foods, that choice alone will lead you to feel better. Stop compromising! The unhealthy gut microbiome produces bioactive compounds that powerfully influence the central nervous system (CNS), creating unhealthy cravings that are difficult to ignore. Is it YOU who wants another candy bar, pastry and espresso, salted fries or bowl of pasta, or is it the bugs inside of you? For those of us who are health practitioners, awareness of these phenomena can help us educate and treat our patients. Patients need to fully understand what made them so sick before they will agree to do what they need to do to get well. They must understand that there will be a die-off of “bad” microbes before the healthy new ones can take over, and that detoxing can take time – sometimes more than a year or two. Dietary restrictions have to be spelled out clearly if patients are going to be successful in their healing. Children who were placed on round after round of antibiotics, seemingly from birth, have immune systems that are totally compromised. These children with hypersensitivities are unable to withstand the world as it is. We see this in their eating habits, health issues and emotional behaviors. I fear for their future, and ours as well. It would be interesting to study what such a child would be like if they were fed a healthy, chemical-free diet and protected from electromagnetic field smog and stray electricity. It is my belief that even autistic children would flourish in such an environment and likely become the prodigies of the future. Changing to an entirely clean diet may seem utterly overwhelming to families with poor eating habits (80% of Americans). If we propose permanent dietary changes as restrictive as the complete avoidance of all trans fats, sugars, flours, grains, and processed foods of any kind (in other words, inflammatory foods), parents freak out. Instead, it is better to suggest that they start with a short period of time – three months – to restrict their child’s diet. However, they will find that the changes in the child’s physical, mental and emotional health and their unmanageable behaviors will radically change within less than two weeks, after which the dietary restrictions will be viewed as a real godsend and will be easy to maintain. Parents of young children may have to use bribes (e.g., toys) to introduce healthier eating habits. In the beginning, tantrums and meltdowns are to be expected. It takes three days to break an addiction, so usually within four days, the child is hungry enough and willing to try new foods like leafy greens if they are prepared in a tasty manner. Get some nutritional counseling and get started. Honestly, the health of your child, your family, your community and our earth ALL begin here. We must take responsibility for what we put into our bodies and understand the dangers of factory farming, including chemicals introduced into the soil, water, air and food that we consume. In the 1960s, people were alarmed by the effects of DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), but now the primary chemical culprit is glyphosate. The chemical breakdown of glyphosate is AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid). When testing the environment or the blood for glyphosate poisoning, we must test for both glyphosate and AMPA to understand the seriousness of these and other toxic chemicals, which are now found worldwide, even in the rain. It is only through grassroots movements that the use of GMOs, harmful chemicals and factory farming will change. It is entirely up to us. Read labels, buy organic, and avoid plastics, and you will be on your way to a healthier future for your family and generations to come. Stop using antibacterial hand sanitizer and get some dirt under your fingernails. Touch the earth and let her touch you. In Chinese medicine, we think about the earth element when it comes to providing nutrients for the whole body and keeping the immune system vital and strong. Hippocrates said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” I would contend that Chinese medicine said this first. Please see 88.15-88.16 Fire Branch/Fire All for “The microbiome (part one).” •  When I think of Four Horses, I think “immune system:” Four Horses are used to address all kinds of immune system reactions, from common cold and allergies to something as rare as the autoimmune disease known as pemphigoid/pemphigus. Allergic reactions usually involve some kind of trigger that pushes the liver beyond its capacity to detoxify the system when the Lung and Spleen are weak, and immunity is compromised. Four Horses have the Reaction Areas of the Lung and Liver. The Lung governs the surface (or Wei qi) and the Liver cleans the blood. When the Wei qi is weak, the body is vulnerable to external wind; when the Liver is weak, the blood is not clean and internal wind results. Found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses relate to both wind and phlegm. Their extraordinary power comes from their ability to strengthen both the Lung and Liver through boosting the Spleen, cleaning the blood and expelling wind. •  Energetic pathways: Below is an explanation of the many different ways in which the energetics of Four Horses combine. We have done our best to tease out these relationships in a linear way in order that they might be more easily understood; however, they layer one upon another and are inextricably interwoven, interrelated, and not necessarily presented in order of importance. Their many overlapping energetic interactions make Four Horses extremely clinically useful: Spleen/Stomach: The Spleen governs the muscles, and together with the Stomach, it is responsible for postnatal qi. Four Horses points are located near the Stomach channel in the large quadriceps muscles of the thigh. Due to the abundant nerve and blood supply found there, needling these points provides ample tonification of qi and blood. Because of this earth element relationship, these points not only have a powerful influence over the immune system, but also are helpful in treating phlegm conditions such as hypothyroid and/or goiter. Muscle treats muscle, which enables us to use these points to treat muscle weakness or atrophy, multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Because Four Horses points regulate the Spleen and Stomach, and the Stomach channel travels to the face, they are also used to treat diseases of the eyes, ears, nose and throat. •  Lung/Spleen: The Lung governs the Wei qi, which is responsible for the surface of the body and prevents the invasion of external pathogens. Because of the relationship of the Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP), Four Horses points tonify both Lung and Spleen qi. This makes them highly useful in the treatment of any kind of immune system deficiency, including autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, cough, colds or flus, phlegm, and skin diseases. The Spleen governs the muscles, and muscle treats muscle, but muscle also treats the skin. In most cases of Spleen deficiency, we see not only signs of internal dampness but also damp skin diseases, muscle weakness, loose stools and fatigue. •  Lung/Large Intenstine: In addition to the above relationships, Tai Yin and Yang Ming are connected through the internal/external relationship of the Lung and Large Intestine, and both have a strong influence over external wind. We frequently add LI20 Welcome Fragrance as a Guiding Point for issues on the face, such as acne, but it is especially good for sinus infections or inflammation, sinus headaches, as well as other nasal problems, such as polyps or atrophy. Nasal atrophy is the loss of the ability to smell and therefore also taste. It frequently occurs after surgery as a side effect to anesthesia but also may be related to other kinds of drug interactions. See 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) for my unique and detailed needling instructions. •  Large Intestine/Liver: In Tung’s acupuncture, we recognize a special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and Foot Jue Yin (LV), which work together to detoxify the body. While the Large Intestine and Lungs are closely related (the Large Intestine expels toxins through the bowels, the Lungs through the skin), the Liver detoxifies the entire body by filtering the blood. Both the Liver and the Large Intestine expel wind – the Liver internally, and the Large Intestine externally. Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is located anterior to GB31 Wind Market, so Four Horses is associated with all kinds of wind diseases due to the internal/ external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder (wood and wind), making Four Horses very useful in the treatment of dizziness, vertigo, Meniere’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and hyperthyroidism. •  Lung/Liver: Four Horses points have the Reaction Areas of Lung and Liver; while the Lung governs the surface, the Liver cleans the blood. As previously discussed, one of the most common indications of a compromised immune system is an allergic skin reaction that happens when the surface is weak and the liver is overworked. Because Four Horses can be used to expel wind and move the blood, it is especially useful in treating allergic reactions that cause itching, rashes, psoriasis, eczema or fungal infections. Lung/Urinary Bladder: The Chinese have a saying: “The wind chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Never is this more evident than in situations of wind chill lodging in the neck and upper back, causing not only muscle spasm but also the onset of most common colds and flu. There is a special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB), characterized in part by the ability of both to disperse fluids. When the evil wind chill penetrates the Wei qi, governed by the Lungs, we use surface-dispersing herbs to open the exterior and induce sweating, thus relieving the Tai Yang upper back. The Tai Yin/Tai Yang relationship is also evident in the use of Four Horses for thorax pain (front or back), chest and rib pain, as well as Lung-deficient-type UB channel sciatica. However, I rarely use Four Horses for sciatica unless the patient also has another condition such as asthma, allergies or psoriasis, for which Four Horses points are indicated. •  Cough and asthma: Four Horses are my primary points and favorites for asthma and pneumonia, but they are also very good for any kind of cough, whether it is acute or chronic. If the wind chill has lodged in the upper back muscles, or if the lungs feel heavy or tight, cup the entire neck and upper back (with the patient sitting upright), then needle Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/ Water Through. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) bilaterally is especially helpful in severe cases; it will open the lungs and immediately calm the breathing. If you are not comfortable bleeding LU5, it could be bilaterally needled. Water Gold/Water Through points tonify the Lungs and Kidneys and are great when a patient has been coughing or wheezing for an extended period of time. Because Water Gold/Water Through points are used for lower back pain and sexual dysfunction, they also can treat urinary incontinence that may arise toward the end of a severe upper respiratory infection. If the patient is experiencing allergic asthma, I am also likely to add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) to open the sinuses. •  Common cold: Illness may be avoided altogether if, within a few hours of being chilled, the patient takes an extremely hot shower with water beating upon the upper back and neck. This corresponds with the Chinese teaching, “The wind-chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Often patients feel a shudder of cold coming out through the surface while they stand under the steaming hot water. They need to be careful not to get exposed to another chill after the hot shower (bring warm clothes into the bathroom). A good sweat, followed by a change of clothes, should relieve the chill. Treatments: •  Cupping: When a patient has a wind-chill invasion, I immediately cup their entire upper back to remove it. This must be done within a few hours of the exposure for best results, although it may still be appropriate days later if the chill is still lodged in the body. •  Cold/flu, sinusitis, allergies: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as Guiding Points; optional 11.17 Wood (Anger). •  Optional: Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment: Bilaterally needle ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7 in this order, tonifying the bottom and sedating the top), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20). For headache from a common cold: Unilaterally needle 22.04 Da Bai and A.04 San Cha Three (one point on each side). •  For sore throat: Bleed VT.01 Throat Nine Moths or bleed LU11 and LI1. •  To clear the sinuses: Needle 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) toward Yin Tang. •  Optional: To open the nose: Bilaterally needle proximal point 11.17 Wood (Anger). For nasal blockage with pain or headache: Unilaterally needle 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43). •  Allergy option: Needle 11.17 Wood (Anger), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20), LI4/LV3 Four Gates or 22.04 Da Bai. •  For ear pain: Bleed 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles. •  Hyperthyroid: Four Horses points emphasize the relationship between wood and metal, as well as that of qi and blood. They treat conjunctivitis and hyperthyroid, both of which have a relationship to the Liver. According to TCM, simple goiter is phlegm accumulation in the neck, caused by qi and blood stagnation. Usually a strong emotional component is involved, and if irritability and frustration are also present, the condition may easily transform into Spleen qi (phlegm) obstruction with Liver qi stagnation. This causes Liver fire to rise, resulting in Heart yin deficiency and potentially hyperthyroidism. Because Four Horses points are located between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, they are capable of addressing both wind and phlegm in a powerful way. Due to the relationships between San Jiao and Gallbladder, Gallbladder and Liver, and Spleen and Stomach, and their passage through the neck, where the thyroid gland is located, Four Horses becomes one of the best point patterns in the treatment of hyperthyroid disease, including enlarged thyroid, goiter, and/or related protrusion of the eyeballs. •  Skin diseases: Similar in function to LI11 Qu Chi and 44.06 Shoulder Center (also located in large muscles), Four Horses points treat the skin because needling muscle treats muscle and also treats the skin (Dr. Young, 2008). Skin diseases are more common in places where people eat rich foods, are exposed to environmental toxins, raise pets, etc. Four Horses are fabulous points for the skin – for itching, pruritis, acne, shingles, psoriasis, eczema, and skin fungus as well as thickening of the skin or scleroderma. I have found them to be extraordinary in the treatment of psoriasis (although dietary changes are also essential). If the skin disorder is severe, bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex once a week, because Shao Yang (SJ/GB) governs wind, and Tai Yang (SI/UB) governs the exterior and the skin; both Shao Yang and Tai Yang travel to the back of the ear. See Needling Notes above for further instructions related to the treatment of skin diseases. •  Acne: Four Horses is excellent for treating acne. Nine out of ten patients with acne have a red face. With Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three, the patient’s face becomes less red, their skin improves, and the acne goes away. Over time, even the scars from acne may disappear. Add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as a Guiding Point and treat 1-3 times weekly. Herbs and dietary restrictions are helpful. •  Itching and rashes: Itching and rashes are wind disorders that happen when qi, blood, wind and fire are fighting. With wind disorders, we must disperse wind, and vitalize and clean the blood. Though invaluable for itching and rashes, Four Horses can be rotated with the primary meridian points, SP6 San Yin Jiao, SP10 Xue Hai, LI11 Qu Chi, Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point) and HT8 Shao Fu (as A.04 San Cha Three). •  SP6 San Yin Jiao strengthens the Spleen and eliminates dampness. •  SP10 Xue Hai cools the blood and removes dampness to stop itching. •  LI11 Qu Chi clears heat, cools the blood, expels wind and alleviates itching. •  Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point), Hundred Insect Burrow, is located 1.0 cun proximal to SP10 and is used to relieve itching and soothe the skin. •  HT8 Shao Fu (which is reached via A.04 San Cha Three) is very good for itching because itching and pain belong to the Heart. As a Ying-Spring and fire point, HT8 disperses heat and treats changes in face color (not due to emotions). •  Psoriasis: I have successfully treated countless cases of psoriasis using Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three. As long as the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas (also known as Poison Points) are free of psoriasis, I thoroughly cup them weekly, until no color appears. For the quickest results, ask the patient to avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, dairy, wheat, sugar and albumin (egg whites). Eating egg yolks may reduce itching. Some patients are unable to follow these extreme dietary restrictions; however, in severe cases I will not treat them unless they are willing to comply. It is important that psoriasis patients wear only cotton next to their skin, and stay off of synthetic carpets, AstroTurf, and any other kind of chemical irritant. •  Case history: I first treated a patient with severe psoriasis in 1988. He was Filipino, so his natural skin color was brown; however, he had psoriatic lesions from head to toe, making his skin appear pink and white. His joints were also affected, swollen and inflamed from advanced psoriasis. I treated him using Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, dietary restrictions and a strong herbal formula. I advised him to take daily “sun baths” in the nude because sunshine is helpful in healing this kind of skin disease. Within three months, the pink and white lesions had turned to a light tan color and no longer looked crusted or inflamed. I then was able to cup the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. Within six months, his skin fully recovered, his joints were no longer painful, and he was able to discontinue treatment, maintaining his new healthy diet. •  Case history: A fifty-year-old real estate agent came to see me because of severe psoriasis on his hands. He also had large patches all over his body, but he was less concerned about those, as in his line of work it was necessary that he shake people’s hands. It was always awkward for him when clients saw his hands then withdrew their own. I discussed with him the parameters of treating severe psoriasis (outlined above) and told him that if he was unable to follow the dietary restrictions, I would be unable to help him. This man was addicted to caffeinated energy drinks and enjoyed one or two cocktails every evening. He agreed to the restrictions. After three months, with two or three treatments per week, he was 90% better. He was no longer afraid to offer a handshake. •  Case history: A sixty-year-old woman came to see me for a tangerine-sized patch of psoriasis on the back of her neck. It was dark red, solid and inflamed. It had appeared when she was fifteen years old. She also had psoriasis in and behind her ears and around her anterior hairline. I put her on the usual dietary restrictions and herbs for skin and hot flashes. She could only see me once a month because she lived four hours away. I thoroughly cupped her upper back and DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and seven-star-hammered the healthy skin surrounding the lesion on the back of her neck. I then needled Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. Now, one year later, the lesion on her neck is entirely gone and she has mostly returned to her normal diet. Because she occasionally has one or two tiny spots of psoriasis within her hairline and in or behind her ears, she continues to take her herbal formula at a 25% dose and returns periodically for a maintenance treatment. I recently asked her to topically apply diluted tea tree oil on those areas and to do a better job of drying her ears after showering. •  Case history: A forty-year-old patient, whom I originally saw when she was in her thirties for asthma, returned four years ago with psoriasis on her hands and feet. The psoriasis on her feet was cracked and bleeding, and it prevented her from wearing shoes. She swam regularly in a chlorinated pool. Along with wearing sandals, swimming had caused her skin to suffer from exposure to chlorine, wind and sun, drying it even further. In order to treat this patient, I had to ask her to discontinue swimming until her skin had healed. This and the dietary restrictions were very challenging for her, but she complied. Within six weeks, her skin had improved by eighty percent and she was able to wear her regular shoes. She returned to swimming and maintained her dietary restrictions. After approximately eighteen months of intermittent treatment, I ran an allergy blood panel to determine which foods might cause her immune system to react. We were delighted to find that she had successfully turned off all of her triggers. When I called to give her the results of her blood test and to tell her that she might begin to include some of the foods she had been avoiding, she informed me that she had begun a Weight Watchers program and had already been including small amounts of the forbidden foods for over six months without any exacerbation of her psoriasis, but even more importantly, without triggering an immune reaction. It can be done! •  Case history (scleroderma): A forty-five-year-old man with scleroderma who lived three and a half hours away was referred to my office by an acupuncturist who was leaving his area. The patient had been suffering from scleroderma his entire adult life, with very large areas of scarring on the right side of his back, arm, leg, lateral ankle and foot. It had started in the ankle, so this area was the worst; it was entirely scarred, rigid and devoid of any pigment color. Areas of pigment loss and scarring created a pulling sensation though his right armpit down to his wrist. There was an area of scarring on his right scapula that pulled into his right neck and shoulder areas. Another painful area on his right flank caused a pulling sensation down the entire IT41 band of his right leg, exacerbating the severe disability in his ankle. I began his treatment by cupping all of the affected areas except the ankle, to which I applied warming oil and a heat lamp. The cupping gave him enormous relief; he even shaved his armpit before each treatment so I could apply cups there. The cupping in the armpit and down the medial arm was excruciatingly painful, but the subsequent relief from the pulling sensation of the scleroderma was worth it to him and lasted nearly the entire month between his treatments. He was unable to take herbs but followed the anti-inflammatory diet that I prescribed. His treatments included a full hour of cupping every visit, followed by Four Horses and San Cha Three. I treated him for two years, during which time his skin discontinued coloring after cupping, his scleroderma improved by 70%, and he began a full-time job that precluded him from continuing treatment. •  Tinnitus: Low-pitch tinnitus is most frequently thought of as a Kidney-deficient condition. It tends to get worse when the patient is tired, and it may even stop once in a while. Tinnitus can be difficult to treat, and Kidney tonification does not always help. For these patients, it may be more effective to tonify Spleen qi and yang using Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three and 22.05 Ling Gu. SI3 Hou Xi and/or SI19 Ting Gong may also be helpful. •  Scalp acupuncture: For very stubborn tinnitus, you can thread three needles vertically toward the ear (beginning 1.0 cun above the ear, needle three points, one in the center and two 0.5 cun to either side). This area is known in scalp acupuncture as the “area of hearing and understanding language.” It is very painful to needle because there are multiple blood vessels in this area, so downsize your needle gauge (I use Seirin 00/0.12mm x 30mm needles with dark green handles). •  Guiding Points: SI19 Ting Gong with SJ21 Er Men or SJ22 Er He Liao can be needled on the same side as Guiding Points. •  Tinnitus in TCM: Interesting information is found in Applied Channel Theory in Chinese Medicine by Dr. Wang Ju-Yi and Jason Robertson (2008): “The relationship of the Kidney to the ears is often misunderstood and sometimes leads to ineffective clinical treatment. Classical references should be placed in the context of the Kidney’s relationship to growth, development and decline through the stages of life. In short, the Kidney is most often related to hearing problems in the elderly, when the Kidney essence is thought to wane … generally this is low-pitched tinnitus that is often worse in the afternoon or when the patient is tired. Note: Excess type tinnitus is high-pitched and often more acute ... it often involves problems with dampness or heat in the fluids of the ear. Use points on the Shao Yang meridian to dredge and drain.” •  Formulas (Dr. Young): The classic formula Yi Qi Cong Ming Tong is very useful in the treatment of tinnitus and consists of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tong with Man Jing Zi, Ge Gen, Dang Shen and Sheng Ma. In China, doctors inject Ge Gen at SI19 to treat tinnitus. •  Other ear disorders: For ear pain, otitis media, hearing loss or sudden deafness, Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three may be useful due to the Hand and Foot Shao Yang relationship. Other options might include bleeding the small veins surrounding the outside ankle between the lateral malleoli and GB39, bleeding 11.26 Control Dirt or bleeding LU5. For sudden hearing loss, we might include bilateral needling of 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors. Bleeding 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU16) or needling the three points anterior to the ear (GB2, SI19, SJ21) might also be useful in these cases. For treating otitis media, usually I choose 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles and A.04 San Cha Three on the side opposite the indications, with same-side 22.06 Zhong Bai or SI3 Hou Xi as a Guiding Point. •  Red sclera: Because the Lungs govern the sclera, Four Horses can also treat eyes that are red due to Lung heat. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) or 99.08 Ear Apex is also an outstanding way to clear the eyes. Four Horses includes the specific indication of conjunctivitis. •  Fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and muscle atrophy: We needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three because of the muscle-treating-muscle principle, and because the Spleen governs muscles. Located very near the Stomach channel, in the large quadriceps muscles that have significant nerve and blood supplies, these points tonify Spleen qi, adjust the Spleen and Stomach, and can be very effective in the treatment of muscle weakness, fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. For the same reasons, you might also choose these points for hemiplegia, facial paralysis or spasm. •  Fibromyalgia: This condition is characterized by hypersensitivity of nerve endings. Because of this, if the patient is needle phobic, it is important to downsize needle gauge (I may use dark green handled Seirin needles 00/0.12mm). Cupping may be helpful for particularly inflamed muscles. However, three pumps are necessary to keep the suction on a cup, and that may be excruciating for the patient, so apply one small cup at a time. Liver stagnation causes fibromyalgia, which is especially exacerbated by stress. Treatment is directed toward soothing the Liver and opening stagnation, using LI4/LV3 Four Gates with GB41 Ling Qi and A.04 San Cha Three for whole-body pain. 66.07 Mu Liu can be added to regulate the Liver and tonify earth. 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three is another good treatment option. For fibromyalgia, my favorite formula by far is Xiao Yao Wan, with modifications. •  Multiple sclerosis: One way to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) is with IgG and IgA reactivity screening for myelin basic protein. If these counts are elevated, it is a likely indication of demyelination of the myelin sheath, which protects and insulates the nerve fibers surrounding the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. MS can be temporary or permanent, depending upon the severity and location of the scars that interrupt nerve impulses to the brain. Early signs include heaviness, numbness, tingling and/or electrical sensations in the hands or legs. TCM recognizes a few typical patterns, made obvious through following the signs and symptoms. Spleen dampness is a common cause of circulatory obstruction, especially when combined with any kind of dampness in the external environment. Poor habits that weaken the power of the Liver and Kidneys are frequently seen, causing poor circulation and weakness in the legs, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision or urinary incontinence, to name a few symptoms. By far the best prevention is a good diet that includes organic foods and excludes caffeine, alcohol, trans fats, cold foods, dairy products and genetically modified foods. Also, proper exercise, sleep and rest are essential in returning MS patients to full health. Following are suggestions for treating MS with Tung’s acupuncture: •  Treatment: The basic principle is to tonify the Spleen and Kidneys, detoxify the liver and brain, and strengthen nerves, tendons and muscles. Treatment should focus on 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors with GB34 Yang Ling Quan, or 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three. If it is difficult for the patient to extend their muscles, add 22.05 Ling Gu and 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3). If there is numbness, add 77.05-77.07 Three Weights with 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to wake up the brain and circulate the blood. Though individual herbs must be prescribed, Shao Yao Gan Cao plus Ge Gen is useful in softening tense or hard muscles; it will cause a soft stool, so it should be used to bowel tolerance. People with a damp Spleen may have a soft stool already; however, constipation can also be an issue when nerve conduction is sufficiently interrupted. •  Afterbirth wind (Dr. Lee): “In particular, I like to use Four Horses for the treatment of post-partum invasion of external cold, causing joint pain. Since these points are on the Stomach channel, they treat a wide range of diseases, especially those having to do with the Heart” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Thoracic pain: Four Horses is very effective for breast pain and chest pain, including chest pain due to injury, especially if the pain moves from the front to the sides. Because the points are found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses treats breast and chest pain related to Yang Ming, but also treats pain that migrates to the side, relating to Shao Yang. Due to the Shao Yang connection, these points can be used bilaterally or unilaterally, for opposite-side pain of the upper back, chest, abdomen, rib, and intercostal or flank pain. Opposite-side needling is appropriate for hemiplegia, especially if there are also Lung or Liver conditions. •  Breast cancer: For breast cancer, needle 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop and bleed Four Horses (Dr. Young).",

If severe, bleed DU14, UB13, UB15 to clear heat; the patient should eat less sugar, especially chocolate, and no oily or spicy foods. The patient should eat more fruit and vegetables, wash the face often, avoid staying out late, and avoid sunlight because the heat worsens acne. Daily bowel movements are important to remove toxins from the blood. •  Itching and rashes: Cup DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas; bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses (see Needling Notes); sedate LI11 Qu Chi and SP10 Xue Hai; Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point). •  Neck rashes: Needle bilaterally or on the side opposite the indications: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 44.06 Shoulder Center; bleed 99.08 Ear Apex. •  Urticaria (hives): Cup the navel; bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex; bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three; optionally add 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31).

For post-herpetic pain, to release the virus from the nerve endings, seven-star hammer (never before the scabs have fallen off). •  Rib pain that has moved from the chest to the sides: Needle bilaterally or on the opposite side: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 33.04 Fire Threaded (SJ6), GB34 Yang Ling Quan. •  Intercostal pain: Needle opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, with 66.09 Water Curve (GB41) on the same side as the pain. •  Back pain on both sides: Bleed UB40 Wei Zhong (any vein in the popliteal crease); bilaterally needle SI3 Hou Xi with UB65 Shu Gu; 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with 22.01 Double Child, 88.11 Passing Back, 77.04 Catching Ball (Tung’s UB57). •  Fibromyalgia: See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Comments. •  Multiple sclerosis: See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Comments. •  Leg numbness: To tonify qi, bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with bilateral or opposite-side 44.06 Shoulder Center. •  Hyperthyroid: For shaky, nervous, sweating, hungry wind disease, open the Four Gates (LI4/LV3) to soothe the Liver: bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with 88.12 Bright Yellow; 88.12-88.14 Three Yellows with 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31); bilaterally needle or bleed 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold. •  Goiter: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; bilaterally needle or bleed 77.05-77.07 Three Weights or 77.24-77.25 Leg Five/One Thousand Gold. •  Deviation of the mouth: Bleed 77.07 Third Weight; needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 88.09 Passing Kidney (Dr. Young). •  Facial twitch: Needle bilaterally or on the opposite side: 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31), 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles, 22.04 Da Bai, SI3 Hou Xi. Opposite-side treatments are usually applied, unless the problem is chronic. I have found the formula Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin to be enormously helpful, with symptoms abating within two or three doses; however, the patient should continue taking the herbs for at least 4-5 days. They should avoid caffeine and alcohol. •  Chest or abdominal pain: Needle opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; unilaterally needle 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4), PC6 Nei Guan. For abdominal pain, needle SP4 first, followed by PC6. For chest pain, needle PC6 first to direct the treatment to the chest, followed by SP4. •  Lateral lower abdominal pain (between ST and GB channels): Needle 22.05 Ling Gu; SJ5 Wai Guan; PC6 Nei Guan; 88.17-88.19 Four Horses. Though any of the previous points might be used, I am unlikely to employ them. I would choose opposite-side 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43), with unilateral 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4) and PC6 Nei Guan. •  Breast cancer: Needle 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop; bleed 88.17-88.19 Four Horses (Dr. Young), but only if you see good blood vessels in this area. •  Conjunctivitis: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; bleed same-side 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex or Tai Yang (Extra Point). •  Heel pain: Needle bilateral or opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, Hand Heel Points (PC7 and one additional point 1.0 cun distal)",

        "techniques": "Needle perpendicularly 0.8 - 2.5 cun . Needle bilaterally, except when treating pain. For pain, needle contralateral to the affected side. | Johnson: Dao Ma: The combination of 88.17-88.19 is known as Four Horses. 88.17 Four Horses Middle is the Chief Point and the most powerful point for the Lungs. •  Palpation: Four Horses points are easy to locate because at each point, a depression, small hole or pool of energy can be felt. •  45-degree angle: A reliable approach to locating Four Horses is to identify where the muscles of the thigh change from a horizontal to a vertical plane, on a line originating at the lateral corner of the patella and extending up the thigh. Though the needles are inserted perpendicularly, after insertion they appear to be at a 45-degree angle to the body. Please see inset in point illustration above. •  Bilateral vs. unilateral insertion: Four Horses points are needled bilaterally to treat conditions such as asthma, colds and flus, allergies, thyroid and skin disorders. For conditions located on one side of the body, such as facial paralysis, hemiplegia, sciatica, flank pain, rib pain or breast pain, an opposite-side needling technique may be used. Upper back pain is an indication that may require either bilateral needling or the opposite-side technique. •  Insertion and stimulation: Typically, 88.17 Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is needled first. The other two points are Supplementary Points, located using 88.17 as a reference. After insertion, stimulate Four Horses Middle, and then the outer two points again. •  Needle with qi: For optimal results, please put some qi into your needling. Insert the needle deeply, hold the handle firmly, catch the qi and strongly stimulate these points. I am not suggesting that a patient should experience pain when receiving Four Horses; they should not. But very strong and forceful energy is available here, and you have an opportunity to direct and deliver it. Don’t waste the opportunity! Patients consistently report strong movement of qi in both directions when I needle these points. Downsize your needle gauge to the patient’s comfort level, and then decisively move the qi for immediate and excellent results. These points do not generally bruise, but be sure to avoid any visible blood vessels. •  Needling technique for skin diseases: It is said that skin treats skin and muscle also treats skin. When using Four Horses to treat skin issues, if time allows, insert the needles to the deepest muscle level and strongly stimulate to call the qi. After ten minutes, pull the needles halfway up (to medium depth) and stimulate again. After an additional ten minutes, pull the needles up to the superficial level again, stimulate, and let the patient retain them for the duration of the treatment (30-40 minutes). The technique of calling the qi and then bringing it to the surface is only used in the treatment of skin disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, shingles, acne, or rashes. When needling for acne on the face, start with the most distal point and needle toward the proximal. •  When time is tight: In my clinic, I may bilaterally needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three as soon as I enter the treatment room. Then I talk with the patient and hear their update, and after ten minutes I raise the needles halfway. Just before leaving the room, I pull the needles up to the superficial level. If the clinic is busy and I don’t have time to pull the needles up in stages, instead I insert them to the deep or medium level, stimulate strongly, then pull the energy to the surface level and cover the patient. However, the more gradual method may yield better results, depending on the skill of the practitioner. •  Retention: For constitutional complaints, Four Horses should be needled deeply and retained for a minimum of 45 minutes to be effective. For secondary complaints, a shorter treatment (20 minutes) with opposite-side needling may be utilized. •  Needling depths: The needling depth may range from 0.8 to 2.5 cun. At the most distal point, the needle typically contacts bone; when it does, tap it very gently to avoid injury to the periosteum. To insert to the necessary depth, I use needles of 40-50mm length. If a patient has large thighs, 60mm needles may be required. •  Depth: 0.8-2.5 cun",
        "comments": "My favorite points: The name Four Horses refers to the power of a four-horse carriage moving with extraordinary momentum. A one-horse carriage ride through the countryside on a lazy Sunday afternoon would not be a fitting metaphor for the strong and lasting effects of these amazing points. This three- or six-point pattern is easy to locate and very versatile. These points are prized by Tung’s acupuncture practitioners for their use in treating a wide and diverse array of disorders, especially lung diseases, including: impaired breathing and asthma, skin conditions, rhinitis, tuberculosis, rib pain, upper back pain, thyroid problems, and sciatica or lower back pain due to Lung deficiency. These points are extremely effective for pain related to Lung deficiency, especially when there is excess fatigue; for that reason, they are also primary points for fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis. I love these points and use them more frequently in my practice than any other Dao Ma pattern. •  A.04 San Cha Three: Nearly every time I needle Four Horses, I add A.04 San Cha Three (needled toward HT8 Shao Fu), as they complement each other perfectly. This combination is my first choice for colds and flus, but it is also an excellent choice for skin conditions, allergies (seasonal or otherwise), and immune system weakness. (See A.04 San Cha Three.) •  The microbiome (part two): Our bodies are throwbacks to the era of hunters and gatherers, but since those times our diet and environment have radically changed. Because of our consumption of animals that are factory raised on GMO corn, steroids, and antibiotics, and also because many people ingest large quantities of sugar, caffeine, drugs or alcohol daily, we have created a world of suffering for ourselves and other beings. We are witnessing an unprecedented rise in autoimmune diseases, diabetes, autism, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and a host of other man-made calamities. Using the technology developed during the Human Genome Project (2003), scientists have newly discovered the human microbiome and the fact that we are composed of 50-100 trillion organisms that are non-human. These organisms that we host are sometimes working in harmony with us as a healthy microbiome, and thus constitute the majority of our immune system. However, in more recent history this relationship has become less harmonious due to the creation of a pathological biofilm, the overuse of antibiotics, poor diets, toxic chemical and environmental exposures, and a more or less sedentary, feasting lifestyle. The good news is that we are beginning to understand that we have been missing a very crucial piece of information, recently revealed by “The Microbiome Project.” Our microbiome is heavily influenced by our environment – what is around us. Chronic disease is the interaction between our environment and our genetic triggers; thus, the triggers alone are not a death sentence, and they may never genetically express, but for our choices and environments. Sadly, researchers have found that chronic disease processes begin in utero, as babies’ umbilical cords are loaded with more than two hundred and eighty known toxins, such as BPA (bisphenol A) and glyphosate, which poison our developing children before they even enter the world. This reality is sad and horrifying, and my only intention in sharing it is to awaken you to the real danger. We are not going to wake up in our world and discover all of the remarkable things that we did while we were sleeping; rather, we must awaken and take responsibility for the mess that we have created, and do everything in our power to clean it up immediately. The planet and future generations depend upon our conscious actions. It is absolutely crucial to understand that we control our fate. We must recover our leaky guts and immune systems by rebuilding our microbiome through cleansing and detoxing our bodies. Very simply, this means that if you choose to eat organic foods, that choice alone will lead you to feel better. Stop compromising! The unhealthy gut microbiome produces bioactive compounds that powerfully influence the central nervous system (CNS), creating unhealthy cravings that are difficult to ignore. Is it YOU who wants another candy bar, pastry and espresso, salted fries or bowl of pasta, or is it the bugs inside of you? For those of us who are health practitioners, awareness of these phenomena can help us educate and treat our patients. Patients need to fully understand what made them so sick before they will agree to do what they need to do to get well. They must understand that there will be a die-off of “bad” microbes before the healthy new ones can take over, and that detoxing can take time – sometimes more than a year or two. Dietary restrictions have to be spelled out clearly if patients are going to be successful in their healing. Children who were placed on round after round of antibiotics, seemingly from birth, have immune systems that are totally compromised. These children with hypersensitivities are unable to withstand the world as it is. We see this in their eating habits, health issues and emotional behaviors. I fear for their future, and ours as well. It would be interesting to study what such a child would be like if they were fed a healthy, chemical-free diet and protected from electromagnetic field smog and stray electricity. It is my belief that even autistic children would flourish in such an environment and likely become the prodigies of the future. Changing to an entirely clean diet may seem utterly overwhelming to families with poor eating habits (80% of Americans). If we propose permanent dietary changes as restrictive as the complete avoidance of all trans fats, sugars, flours, grains, and processed foods of any kind (in other words, inflammatory foods), parents freak out. Instead, it is better to suggest that they start with a short period of time – three months – to restrict their child’s diet. However, they will find that the changes in the child’s physical, mental and emotional health and their unmanageable behaviors will radically change within less than two weeks, after which the dietary restrictions will be viewed as a real godsend and will be easy to maintain. Parents of young children may have to use bribes (e.g., toys) to introduce healthier eating habits. In the beginning, tantrums and meltdowns are to be expected. It takes three days to break an addiction, so usually within four days, the child is hungry enough and willing to try new foods like leafy greens if they are prepared in a tasty manner. Get some nutritional counseling and get started. Honestly, the health of your child, your family, your community and our earth ALL begin here. We must take responsibility for what we put into our bodies and understand the dangers of factory farming, including chemicals introduced into the soil, water, air and food that we consume. In the 1960s, people were alarmed by the effects of DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), but now the primary chemical culprit is glyphosate. The chemical breakdown of glyphosate is AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid). When testing the environment or the blood for glyphosate poisoning, we must test for both glyphosate and AMPA to understand the seriousness of these and other toxic chemicals, which are now found worldwide, even in the rain. It is only through grassroots movements that the use of GMOs, harmful chemicals and factory farming will change. It is entirely up to us. Read labels, buy organic, and avoid plastics, and you will be on your way to a healthier future for your family and generations to come. Stop using antibacterial hand sanitizer and get some dirt under your fingernails. Touch the earth and let her touch you. In Chinese medicine, we think about the earth element when it comes to providing nutrients for the whole body and keeping the immune system vital and strong. Hippocrates said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” I would contend that Chinese medicine said this first. Please see 88.15-88.16 Fire Branch/Fire All for “The microbiome (part one).” •  When I think of Four Horses, I think “immune system:” Four Horses are used to address all kinds of immune system reactions, from common cold and allergies to something as rare as the autoimmune disease known as pemphigoid/pemphigus. Allergic reactions usually involve some kind of trigger that pushes the liver beyond its capacity to detoxify the system when the Lung and Spleen are weak, and immunity is compromised. Four Horses have the Reaction Areas of the Lung and Liver. The Lung governs the surface (or Wei qi) and the Liver cleans the blood. When the Wei qi is weak, the body is vulnerable to external wind; when the Liver is weak, the blood is not clean and internal wind results. Found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses relate to both wind and phlegm. Their extraordinary power comes from their ability to strengthen both the Lung and Liver through boosting the Spleen, cleaning the blood and expelling wind. •  Energetic pathways: Below is an explanation of the many different ways in which the energetics of Four Horses combine. We have done our best to tease out these relationships in a linear way in order that they might be more easily understood; however, they layer one upon another and are inextricably interwoven, interrelated, and not necessarily presented in order of importance. Their many overlapping energetic interactions make Four Horses extremely clinically useful: Spleen/Stomach: The Spleen governs the muscles, and together with the Stomach, it is responsible for postnatal qi. Four Horses points are located near the Stomach channel in the large quadriceps muscles of the thigh. Due to the abundant nerve and blood supply found there, needling these points provides ample tonification of qi and blood. Because of this earth element relationship, these points not only have a powerful influence over the immune system, but also are helpful in treating phlegm conditions such as hypothyroid and/or goiter. Muscle treats muscle, which enables us to use these points to treat muscle weakness or atrophy, multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Because Four Horses points regulate the Spleen and Stomach, and the Stomach channel travels to the face, they are also used to treat diseases of the eyes, ears, nose and throat. •  Lung/Spleen: The Lung governs the Wei qi, which is responsible for the surface of the body and prevents the invasion of external pathogens. Because of the relationship of the Hand and Foot Tai Yin (LU/SP), Four Horses points tonify both Lung and Spleen qi. This makes them highly useful in the treatment of any kind of immune system deficiency, including autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, cough, colds or flus, phlegm, and skin diseases. The Spleen governs the muscles, and muscle treats muscle, but muscle also treats the skin. In most cases of Spleen deficiency, we see not only signs of internal dampness but also damp skin diseases, muscle weakness, loose stools and fatigue. •  Lung/Large Intenstine: In addition to the above relationships, Tai Yin and Yang Ming are connected through the internal/external relationship of the Lung and Large Intestine, and both have a strong influence over external wind. We frequently add LI20 Welcome Fragrance as a Guiding Point for issues on the face, such as acne, but it is especially good for sinus infections or inflammation, sinus headaches, as well as other nasal problems, such as polyps or atrophy. Nasal atrophy is the loss of the ability to smell and therefore also taste. It frequently occurs after surgery as a side effect to anesthesia but also may be related to other kinds of drug interactions. See 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) for my unique and detailed needling instructions. •  Large Intestine/Liver: In Tung’s acupuncture, we recognize a special relationship between the Hand Yang Ming (LI) and Foot Jue Yin (LV), which work together to detoxify the body. While the Large Intestine and Lungs are closely related (the Large Intestine expels toxins through the bowels, the Lungs through the skin), the Liver detoxifies the entire body by filtering the blood. Both the Liver and the Large Intestine expel wind – the Liver internally, and the Large Intestine externally. Four Horses Middle, the Chief Point, is located anterior to GB31 Wind Market, so Four Horses is associated with all kinds of wind diseases due to the internal/ external relationship between the Liver and Gallbladder (wood and wind), making Four Horses very useful in the treatment of dizziness, vertigo, Meniere’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and hyperthyroidism. •  Lung/Liver: Four Horses points have the Reaction Areas of Lung and Liver; while the Lung governs the surface, the Liver cleans the blood. As previously discussed, one of the most common indications of a compromised immune system is an allergic skin reaction that happens when the surface is weak and the liver is overworked. Because Four Horses can be used to expel wind and move the blood, it is especially useful in treating allergic reactions that cause itching, rashes, psoriasis, eczema or fungal infections. Lung/Urinary Bladder: The Chinese have a saying: “The wind chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Never is this more evident than in situations of wind chill lodging in the neck and upper back, causing not only muscle spasm but also the onset of most common colds and flu. There is a special relationship between the Hand Tai Yin (LU) and Foot Tai Yang (UB), characterized in part by the ability of both to disperse fluids. When the evil wind chill penetrates the Wei qi, governed by the Lungs, we use surface-dispersing herbs to open the exterior and induce sweating, thus relieving the Tai Yang upper back. The Tai Yin/Tai Yang relationship is also evident in the use of Four Horses for thorax pain (front or back), chest and rib pain, as well as Lung-deficient-type UB channel sciatica. However, I rarely use Four Horses for sciatica unless the patient also has another condition such as asthma, allergies or psoriasis, for which Four Horses points are indicated. •  Cough and asthma: Four Horses are my primary points and favorites for asthma and pneumonia, but they are also very good for any kind of cough, whether it is acute or chronic. If the wind chill has lodged in the upper back muscles, or if the lungs feel heavy or tight, cup the entire neck and upper back (with the patient sitting upright), then needle Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.19-1010.20 Water Gold/ Water Through. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) bilaterally is especially helpful in severe cases; it will open the lungs and immediately calm the breathing. If you are not comfortable bleeding LU5, it could be bilaterally needled. Water Gold/Water Through points tonify the Lungs and Kidneys and are great when a patient has been coughing or wheezing for an extended period of time. Because Water Gold/Water Through points are used for lower back pain and sexual dysfunction, they also can treat urinary incontinence that may arise toward the end of a severe upper respiratory infection. If the patient is experiencing allergic asthma, I am also likely to add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) to open the sinuses. •  Common cold: Illness may be avoided altogether if, within a few hours of being chilled, the patient takes an extremely hot shower with water beating upon the upper back and neck. This corresponds with the Chinese teaching, “The wind-chill evil enters through the back of the neck.” Often patients feel a shudder of cold coming out through the surface while they stand under the steaming hot water. They need to be careful not to get exposed to another chill after the hot shower (bring warm clothes into the bathroom). A good sweat, followed by a change of clothes, should relieve the chill. Treatments: •  Cupping: When a patient has a wind-chill invasion, I immediately cup their entire upper back to remove it. This must be done within a few hours of the exposure for best results, although it may still be appropriate days later if the chill is still lodged in the body. •  Cold/flu, sinusitis, allergies: Bilaterally needle 88.17-88.19 Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three and 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as Guiding Points; optional 11.17 Wood (Anger). •  Optional: Dr. Miriam Lee’s Ten Great Needles Treatment: Bilaterally needle ST36, SP6, LI11, LI4, LU7 in this order, tonifying the bottom and sedating the top), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20). For headache from a common cold: Unilaterally needle 22.04 Da Bai and A.04 San Cha Three (one point on each side). •  For sore throat: Bleed VT.01 Throat Nine Moths or bleed LU11 and LI1. •  To clear the sinuses: Needle 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) toward Yin Tang. •  Optional: To open the nose: Bilaterally needle proximal point 11.17 Wood (Anger). For nasal blockage with pain or headache: Unilaterally needle 66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43). •  Allergy option: Needle 11.17 Wood (Anger), 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20), LI4/LV3 Four Gates or 22.04 Da Bai. •  For ear pain: Bleed 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles. •  Hyperthyroid: Four Horses points emphasize the relationship between wood and metal, as well as that of qi and blood. They treat conjunctivitis and hyperthyroid, both of which have a relationship to the Liver. According to TCM, simple goiter is phlegm accumulation in the neck, caused by qi and blood stagnation. Usually a strong emotional component is involved, and if irritability and frustration are also present, the condition may easily transform into Spleen qi (phlegm) obstruction with Liver qi stagnation. This causes Liver fire to rise, resulting in Heart yin deficiency and potentially hyperthyroidism. Because Four Horses points are located between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, they are capable of addressing both wind and phlegm in a powerful way. Due to the relationships between San Jiao and Gallbladder, Gallbladder and Liver, and Spleen and Stomach, and their passage through the neck, where the thyroid gland is located, Four Horses becomes one of the best point patterns in the treatment of hyperthyroid disease, including enlarged thyroid, goiter, and/or related protrusion of the eyeballs. •  Skin diseases: Similar in function to LI11 Qu Chi and 44.06 Shoulder Center (also located in large muscles), Four Horses points treat the skin because needling muscle treats muscle and also treats the skin (Dr. Young, 2008). Skin diseases are more common in places where people eat rich foods, are exposed to environmental toxins, raise pets, etc. Four Horses are fabulous points for the skin – for itching, pruritis, acne, shingles, psoriasis, eczema, and skin fungus as well as thickening of the skin or scleroderma. I have found them to be extraordinary in the treatment of psoriasis (although dietary changes are also essential). If the skin disorder is severe, bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex once a week, because Shao Yang (SJ/GB) governs wind, and Tai Yang (SI/UB) governs the exterior and the skin; both Shao Yang and Tai Yang travel to the back of the ear. See Needling Notes above for further instructions related to the treatment of skin diseases. •  Acne: Four Horses is excellent for treating acne. Nine out of ten patients with acne have a red face. With Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three, the patient’s face becomes less red, their skin improves, and the acne goes away. Over time, even the scars from acne may disappear. Add 1010.15 Welcome Fragrance (LI20) as a Guiding Point and treat 1-3 times weekly. Herbs and dietary restrictions are helpful. •  Itching and rashes: Itching and rashes are wind disorders that happen when qi, blood, wind and fire are fighting. With wind disorders, we must disperse wind, and vitalize and clean the blood. Though invaluable for itching and rashes, Four Horses can be rotated with the primary meridian points, SP6 San Yin Jiao, SP10 Xue Hai, LI11 Qu Chi, Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point) and HT8 Shao Fu (as A.04 San Cha Three). •  SP6 San Yin Jiao strengthens the Spleen and eliminates dampness. •  SP10 Xue Hai cools the blood and removes dampness to stop itching. •  LI11 Qu Chi clears heat, cools the blood, expels wind and alleviates itching. •  Bai Chong Wo (Extra Point), Hundred Insect Burrow, is located 1.0 cun proximal to SP10 and is used to relieve itching and soothe the skin. •  HT8 Shao Fu (which is reached via A.04 San Cha Three) is very good for itching because itching and pain belong to the Heart. As a Ying-Spring and fire point, HT8 disperses heat and treats changes in face color (not due to emotions). •  Psoriasis: I have successfully treated countless cases of psoriasis using Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three. As long as the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas (also known as Poison Points) are free of psoriasis, I thoroughly cup them weekly, until no color appears. For the quickest results, ask the patient to avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, dairy, wheat, sugar and albumin (egg whites). Eating egg yolks may reduce itching. Some patients are unable to follow these extreme dietary restrictions; however, in severe cases I will not treat them unless they are willing to comply. It is important that psoriasis patients wear only cotton next to their skin, and stay off of synthetic carpets, AstroTurf, and any other kind of chemical irritant. •  Case history: I first treated a patient with severe psoriasis in 1988. He was Filipino, so his natural skin color was brown; however, he had psoriatic lesions from head to toe, making his skin appear pink and white. His joints were also affected, swollen and inflamed from advanced psoriasis. I treated him using Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, dietary restrictions and a strong herbal formula. I advised him to take daily “sun baths” in the nude because sunshine is helpful in healing this kind of skin disease. Within three months, the pink and white lesions had turned to a light tan color and no longer looked crusted or inflamed. I then was able to cup the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas. Within six months, his skin fully recovered, his joints were no longer painful, and he was able to discontinue treatment, maintaining his new healthy diet. •  Case history: A fifty-year-old real estate agent came to see me because of severe psoriasis on his hands. He also had large patches all over his body, but he was less concerned about those, as in his line of work it was necessary that he shake people’s hands. It was always awkward for him when clients saw his hands then withdrew their own. I discussed with him the parameters of treating severe psoriasis (outlined above) and told him that if he was unable to follow the dietary restrictions, I would be unable to help him. This man was addicted to caffeinated energy drinks and enjoyed one or two cocktails every evening. He agreed to the restrictions. After three months, with two or three treatments per week, he was 90% better. He was no longer afraid to offer a handshake. •  Case history: A sixty-year-old woman came to see me for a tangerine-sized patch of psoriasis on the back of her neck. It was dark red, solid and inflamed. It had appeared when she was fifteen years old. She also had psoriasis in and behind her ears and around her anterior hairline. I put her on the usual dietary restrictions and herbs for skin and hot flashes. She could only see me once a month because she lived four hours away. I thoroughly cupped her upper back and DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas and seven-star-hammered the healthy skin surrounding the lesion on the back of her neck. I then needled Four Horses, A.04 San Cha Three, 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points. Now, one year later, the lesion on her neck is entirely gone and she has mostly returned to her normal diet. Because she occasionally has one or two tiny spots of psoriasis within her hairline and in or behind her ears, she continues to take her herbal formula at a 25% dose and returns periodically for a maintenance treatment. I recently asked her to topically apply diluted tea tree oil on those areas and to do a better job of drying her ears after showering. •  Case history: A forty-year-old patient, whom I originally saw when she was in her thirties for asthma, returned four years ago with psoriasis on her hands and feet. The psoriasis on her feet was cracked and bleeding, and it prevented her from wearing shoes. She swam regularly in a chlorinated pool. Along with wearing sandals, swimming had caused her skin to suffer from exposure to chlorine, wind and sun, drying it even further. In order to treat this patient, I had to ask her to discontinue swimming until her skin had healed. This and the dietary restrictions were very challenging for her, but she complied. Within six weeks, her skin had improved by eighty percent and she was able to wear her regular shoes. She returned to swimming and maintained her dietary restrictions. After approximately eighteen months of intermittent treatment, I ran an allergy blood panel to determine which foods might cause her immune system to react. We were delighted to find that she had successfully turned off all of her triggers. When I called to give her the results of her blood test and to tell her that she might begin to include some of the foods she had been avoiding, she informed me that she had begun a Weight Watchers program and had already been including small amounts of the forbidden foods for over six months without any exacerbation of her psoriasis, but even more importantly, without triggering an immune reaction. It can be done! •  Case history (scleroderma): A forty-five-year-old man with scleroderma who lived three and a half hours away was referred to my office by an acupuncturist who was leaving his area. The patient had been suffering from scleroderma his entire adult life, with very large areas of scarring on the right side of his back, arm, leg, lateral ankle and foot. It had started in the ankle, so this area was the worst; it was entirely scarred, rigid and devoid of any pigment color. Areas of pigment loss and scarring created a pulling sensation though his right armpit down to his wrist. There was an area of scarring on his right scapula that pulled into his right neck and shoulder areas. Another painful area on his right flank caused a pulling sensation down the entire IT41 band of his right leg, exacerbating the severe disability in his ankle. I began his treatment by cupping all of the affected areas except the ankle, to which I applied warming oil and a heat lamp. The cupping gave him enormous relief; he even shaved his armpit before each treatment so I could apply cups there. The cupping in the armpit and down the medial arm was excruciatingly painful, but the subsequent relief from the pulling sensation of the scleroderma was worth it to him and lasted nearly the entire month between his treatments. He was unable to take herbs but followed the anti-inflammatory diet that I prescribed. His treatments included a full hour of cupping every visit, followed by Four Horses and San Cha Three. I treated him for two years, during which time his skin discontinued coloring after cupping, his scleroderma improved by 70%, and he began a full-time job that precluded him from continuing treatment. •  Tinnitus: Low-pitch tinnitus is most frequently thought of as a Kidney-deficient condition. It tends to get worse when the patient is tired, and it may even stop once in a while. Tinnitus can be difficult to treat, and Kidney tonification does not always help. For these patients, it may be more effective to tonify Spleen qi and yang using Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three and 22.05 Ling Gu. SI3 Hou Xi and/or SI19 Ting Gong may also be helpful. •  Scalp acupuncture: For very stubborn tinnitus, you can thread three needles vertically toward the ear (beginning 1.0 cun above the ear, needle three points, one in the center and two 0.5 cun to either side). This area is known in scalp acupuncture as the “area of hearing and understanding language.” It is very painful to needle because there are multiple blood vessels in this area, so downsize your needle gauge (I use Seirin 00/0.12mm x 30mm needles with dark green handles). •  Guiding Points: SI19 Ting Gong with SJ21 Er Men or SJ22 Er He Liao can be needled on the same side as Guiding Points. •  Tinnitus in TCM: Interesting information is found in Applied Channel Theory in Chinese Medicine by Dr. Wang Ju-Yi and Jason Robertson (2008): “The relationship of the Kidney to the ears is often misunderstood and sometimes leads to ineffective clinical treatment. Classical references should be placed in the context of the Kidney’s relationship to growth, development and decline through the stages of life. In short, the Kidney is most often related to hearing problems in the elderly, when the Kidney essence is thought to wane … generally this is low-pitched tinnitus that is often worse in the afternoon or when the patient is tired. Note: Excess type tinnitus is high-pitched and often more acute ... it often involves problems with dampness or heat in the fluids of the ear. Use points on the Shao Yang meridian to dredge and drain.” •  Formulas (Dr. Young): The classic formula Yi Qi Cong Ming Tong is very useful in the treatment of tinnitus and consists of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tong with Man Jing Zi, Ge Gen, Dang Shen and Sheng Ma. In China, doctors inject Ge Gen at SI19 to treat tinnitus. •  Other ear disorders: For ear pain, otitis media, hearing loss or sudden deafness, Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three may be useful due to the Hand and Foot Shao Yang relationship. Other options might include bleeding the small veins surrounding the outside ankle between the lateral malleoli and GB39, bleeding 11.26 Control Dirt or bleeding LU5. For sudden hearing loss, we might include bilateral needling of 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors. Bleeding 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU16) or needling the three points anterior to the ear (GB2, SI19, SJ21) might also be useful in these cases. For treating otitis media, usually I choose 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles and A.04 San Cha Three on the side opposite the indications, with same-side 22.06 Zhong Bai or SI3 Hou Xi as a Guiding Point. •  Red sclera: Because the Lungs govern the sclera, Four Horses can also treat eyes that are red due to Lung heat. Bleeding 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) or 99.08 Ear Apex is also an outstanding way to clear the eyes. Four Horses includes the specific indication of conjunctivitis. •  Fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and muscle atrophy: We needle Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three because of the muscle-treating-muscle principle, and because the Spleen governs muscles. Located very near the Stomach channel, in the large quadriceps muscles that have significant nerve and blood supplies, these points tonify Spleen qi, adjust the Spleen and Stomach, and can be very effective in the treatment of muscle weakness, fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. For the same reasons, you might also choose these points for hemiplegia, facial paralysis or spasm. •  Fibromyalgia: This condition is characterized by hypersensitivity of nerve endings. Because of this, if the patient is needle phobic, it is important to downsize needle gauge (I may use dark green handled Seirin needles 00/0.12mm). Cupping may be helpful for particularly inflamed muscles. However, three pumps are necessary to keep the suction on a cup, and that may be excruciating for the patient, so apply one small cup at a time. Liver stagnation causes fibromyalgia, which is especially exacerbated by stress. Treatment is directed toward soothing the Liver and opening stagnation, using LI4/LV3 Four Gates with GB41 Ling Qi and A.04 San Cha Three for whole-body pain. 66.07 Mu Liu can be added to regulate the Liver and tonify earth. 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three is another good treatment option. For fibromyalgia, my favorite formula by far is Xiao Yao Wan, with modifications. •  Multiple sclerosis: One way to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) is with IgG and IgA reactivity screening for myelin basic protein. If these counts are elevated, it is a likely indication of demyelination of the myelin sheath, which protects and insulates the nerve fibers surrounding the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. MS can be temporary or permanent, depending upon the severity and location of the scars that interrupt nerve impulses to the brain. Early signs include heaviness, numbness, tingling and/or electrical sensations in the hands or legs. TCM recognizes a few typical patterns, made obvious through following the signs and symptoms. Spleen dampness is a common cause of circulatory obstruction, especially when combined with any kind of dampness in the external environment. Poor habits that weaken the power of the Liver and Kidneys are frequently seen, causing poor circulation and weakness in the legs, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision or urinary incontinence, to name a few symptoms. By far the best prevention is a good diet that includes organic foods and excludes caffeine, alcohol, trans fats, cold foods, dairy products and genetically modified foods. Also, proper exercise, sleep and rest are essential in returning MS patients to full health. Following are suggestions for treating MS with Tung’s acupuncture: •  Treatment: The basic principle is to tonify the Spleen and Kidneys, detoxify the liver and brain, and strengthen nerves, tendons and muscles. Treatment should focus on 77.18 Shen Guan or 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors with GB34 Yang Ling Quan, or 88.17-88.19 Four Horses with A.04 San Cha Three. If it is difficult for the patient to extend their muscles, add 22.05 Ling Gu and 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3). If there is numbness, add 77.05-77.07 Three Weights with 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop to wake up the brain and circulate the blood. Though individual herbs must be prescribed, Shao Yao Gan Cao plus Ge Gen is useful in softening tense or hard muscles; it will cause a soft stool, so it should be used to bowel tolerance. People with a damp Spleen may have a soft stool already; however, constipation can also be an issue when nerve conduction is sufficiently interrupted. •  Afterbirth wind (Dr. Lee): “In particular, I like to use Four Horses for the treatment of post-partum invasion of external cold, causing joint pain. Since these points are on the Stomach channel, they treat a wide range of diseases, especially those having to do with the Heart” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Thoracic pain: Four Horses is very effective for breast pain and chest pain, including chest pain due to injury, especially if the pain moves from the front to the sides. Because the points are found between the Shao Yang and Yang Ming channels, Four Horses treats breast and chest pain related to Yang Ming, but also treats pain that migrates to the side, relating to Shao Yang. Due to the Shao Yang connection, these points can be used bilaterally or unilaterally, for opposite-side pain of the upper back, chest, abdomen, rib, and intercostal or flank pain. Opposite-side needling is appropriate for hemiplegia, especially if there are also Lung or Liver conditions. •  Breast cancer: For breast cancer, needle 66.06-66.07 Wood Keep/Wood Scoop and bleed Four Horses (Dr. Young).",

Opposite-side treatments are usually applied, unless the problem is chronic. I have found the formula Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin to be enormously helpful, with symptoms abating within two or three doses; however, the patient should continue taking the herbs for at least 4-5 days. They should avoid caffeine and alcohol. •  Chest or abdominal pain: Needle opposite-side 88.17-88.19 Four Horses; unilaterally needle 66.11 Fire Chrysanthemum (SP4), PC6 Nei Guan.

This is the same location as textbook GB31 Wind Market.42 Name indicates location: Master Tung’s use of the name Center Nine Miles for GB31 reflects the fact that it is located halfway between the popliteal crease and the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur, a distance of 18 cun. Tip for easier point location: Because the popliteal crease is not visible when the patient is lying on their back, I always look for this point 8 cun (four fingers twice, plus three fingers) proximal to the top of the patella on the Gallbladder meridian. For the most powerful effect, palpate for the most sensitive point. 42 Many textbooks locate GB31 Wind Market by measuring 7.0 cun above the popliteal crease. This is where we find A.01 Qi Li (GB32), the next point in this book. 413 Thigh Points Note: Some TCM sources advise practitioners to locate GB31 by having the patient extend their arm to the side of their leg. I find this to be an unreliable way to find this point because of the wide variety in the lengths of people’s arms, as well as the fact that most patients are lying down with a bolster beneath their knees during treatment.

        "techniques": "Needle 1 - 2 cun . | Johnson: Dao Ma: Center Nine Miles (GB31) is frequently added to many other point combinations due to its versatility and powerful ability to dispel internal and external wind. It may be needled as the Chief Point in two different Tung Dao Ma combinations. The most frequently used Dao Ma is GB31 needled with the Supplementary Point found 2.0 cun distal, A.01 Seven Miles (GB32). GB31 also may be needled with two Supplementary Points found 1.5 cun anterior and posterior, 88.26 Upper Nine Miles and 88.27 Lower Nine Miles; this Dao Ma pattern is named 88.25- 88.27 Three Nine Miles. Opposite-side vs. bilateral needling: Needle GB31 on the side opposite the indications to treat one-sided pathology, especially for the arm and head; otherwise, it may be needled bilaterally. •  Needle length: This point is best needled deeply enough that you can gently tap the femur, adding a stronger bone-treating-bone Kidney tonification effect. •  Depth: 0.8-2.0 cun ",
        "comments": "GB31 is a favorite of Dr. Young: Dr. Young says that if you are not sure which point to choose, needle GB31, one of Master Tung’s favorite points. Interestingly, Dr. Lee said that if you don’t know what to do, needle ST36. Both GB31 and ST36 address a wide range of conditions. If you can find a point that directly targets a painful area, use it. If there is no direct avenue or if there is pain in multiple areas of the body, choose GB31. •  Energetic pathways: Center Nine Miles is found at the same location as GB31 Feng Shi, also known as Wind Market. It simultaneously adjusts the Spleen, Liver and Kidney because it is located on the Gallbladder channel in large muscle with ample blood and nerve supply (muscle treats muscle/SP), is needled through the IT band (tendon treats tendon/LV), and is deeply needled until the needle gently taps the femur (bone treats bone/KD). •  Shao Yang pathway: Because the Gallbladder channel wraps around the head, GB31 is an excellent choice for issues related to the upper body and head. It is very effective in the treatment of headaches, migraines, vertigo, tinnitus, mental disorders and insomnia due to Liver and Kidney deficiency. •  Pain and paralysis: Because wood governs wind and Shao Yang controls bone, Center Nine Miles disperses wind, tranquilizes the nervous system, relieves pain all over the body and calms the spirit. It can be used to treat any kind of pain, paralysis, nerve damage or weakness. Symptoms that move around or worsen with weather changes are characteristic of wind conditions and present the perfect situation in which to add GB31 Wind Market. •  One-sided pathology or movable pain: We can use opposite-side GB31 for trigeminal neuralgia, facial paralysis, hemiplegia, pain in the hip, leg, arm or ear, or any other kind of one-sided pathology. If a patient does not know the location of the pain, or if the pain moves around (indicating wind in the channels), use Center Nine Miles (GB31) with A.01 (GB32); 88.25-88.27 Three Nine Miles; or 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles. •  Bone spurs and bone disorders: Because Shao Yang (GB) controls bones, with GB39 Xuan Zhong as the Sea of Marrow point, GB31 is used in the treatment of bone diseases and spurs, including those of the spine, knee and heel. It is directly opposite 88.12 Bright Yellow, which is also indicated for bone spurring. See 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One (SI3) for bone spur protocols Hemiplegia from stroke: Stroke patients may come to you immediately following their stroke or some years later. Chronic hemiplegia is more difficult to treat and is often a combination of deficiency and severe stagnation. Acute hemiplegia from stroke is most frequently due to phlegm obstructing the brain. Treatment for hemiplegia is far more successful when it starts immediately. If it is the patient’s first stroke, and treatment begins within six months, full recovery is a real possibility. Massage and physical therapy are an essential part of recovery, yet it is difficult for patients to get enough physical therapy, both professionally and with help from family members, to regain full mobility. With daily acupuncture treatment and proper movement therapies, I usually can get acute stroke patients walking within three weeks of when they begin treatment. Work hard, reduce your fee, and treat the patient at least three times a week, as this will affect the rest of their life. For the heavy lifting involved in treating a stroke patient, be sure someone else is with you or the patient has a family member present. If the patient is older than 65 or if it is their second stroke, their condition will be more difficult to treat and will require herbs as well as acupuncture. If the stroke occurred more than five years prior to treatment, it is unlikely that you will be able to restore their functioning. •  Emotional and spiritual role of the practitioner: Depression is a common problem for stroke patients as well as family members who are their caregivers. Every attempt must be made to overcome lethargy and discouragement in order to get the patient out of their chair and back on their feet. Sobering and encouraging conversations must be faced, even if they are difficult. I recently had one of these challenging conversations with a stroke patient who was resisting her partner’s suggestions. It was necessary for me to point out that even though she had lost control over most of her activities, she was not going to secure her recovery or her future residence by saying, “Don’t tell me what to do” or “You’re not the boss of me,” because both the patient and her partner were elderly. This conversation reinforced the fact that all those concerned, including me, were working for her highest good. As a result, she let go of her stubbornness, reconnected with her partner from her heart, and achieved greater improvements in the following week than she had in the previous five months. Her partner was elated, as hope was restored for the patient and their future together. Remember that in these circumstances, caregivers are seriously challenged by the continual drain of patient care, loss of their own autonomy, and diminishing hope in terms of recovery. My standard stroke treatment: Although acupuncture treatment is generally given on the side opposite the symptoms, I usually start by carefully needling 11.10 Wood Fire bilaterally. Because Wood Fire raises blood pressure, and a stroke usually involves high blood pressure, it is vital that you precisely follow the needling protocol. Please see 11.10 Wood Fire, Cautions for detailed needling instructions. •  Scalp acupuncture: On the side of the head where the stroke occurred (opposite from the hemiplegia), thread needles down the Motor and Sensory Lines (these are more like zones than lines), being sure to cross over the central sulcus and needling toward a line that extends from GB1 and GB2. Now place three or four additional needles, side by side, from 1010.05 Anterior Meeting (DU21) to 1010.06 Posterior Meeting (DU19), or vice versa (DU19-DU21), straight through 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20). These needles will awaken the brain and stimulate the lower part of the body and urinary bladder. Next, I move laterally down the side of the head, optionally placing several needles parallel to those on top, crossing and connecting the Motor and Sensory Lines at the levels of the head, shoulder, arm, hand, thumb and fingers. Please note that the further you descend, the more sensitive the patient will be to your needles (see discussion about aphasia, below) , so you may choose to work with only particular areas on any given day. Though I thread needles nearly the entire length of both the Motor and Sensory Lines/areas, I do not add connecting/crossing needles all the way along these lines; instead, I focus on specific areas. (Connecting at all of the levels mentioned above would involve far too many needles and would be too painful.) The patient should retain these scalp needles for the duration of the treatment. Stimulate them regularly while moving the affected arm and leg. •  Opposite-side treatment for lower extremity: With the patient sitting in their wheelchair, on the side opposite the hemiplegia, needle 22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/ Da Bai with strong qi. While stimulating the scalp points on the very top of the head, ask the patient to stomp their foot, instigating the movement with their mind if they are unable to move their leg. If they are able to stomp their own foot, ask an assistant to support the back of their knee while they move their leg, so they do not tire too easily. If they are unable to lift their leg and stomp their foot, a family member or assistant should do it for them while you aggressively stimulate the scalp needles. Rest and repeat several times or every 10 minutes. •  Transferring the patient to a table: If at all possible, I help the patient to move to a treatment table, allowing for the needling of GB31 and GB32 for the upper extremity treatment. Depending upon the patient’s coordination, I may need to remove the hand needles so that the muscles are not injured during the transfer. After the patient is on the table and I have performed the treatment for the upper extremity (described below), Ling Gu/Da Bai may be replaced. •  Opposite-side treatment for upper extremity: After doing the treatment described above for the lower extremity (including stomping), as the patient lies on a treatment table, needle opposite-side 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) with A.01 Seven Miles (GB32), again using strong stimulation. Have the patient move their arm, or if they cannot do so, ask a family member to move it for them while you stimulate the Motor and Sensory scalp needles along with those connecting at the level of the shoulder, arm or hand. Be sure to move the patient’s entire shoulder girdle in both directions as if they are throwing a ball, and then reverse the motion. Rest and repeat these arm movements several times. If needed, support the patient during this movement so that they will not overdo it and strain their muscles. Once the Gallbladder points have been needled and the arm movements have been made in several rounds, then add movements of the affected leg (including knee to chest, then internal and external rotation), followed by the arm movements; move both the arm and the leg, one after the other, approximately every ten minutes (set a timer) for the duration of the treatment. If your schedule allows you to spend more time with the patient, stimulate the associated needles as you move the limbs. If the patient cannot be moved to a table: 77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles (Tung’s GB34) may be substituted for GB31 and GB32; however, these points are more specifically related to tendons and ligaments, whereas Center Nine Miles (GB31) has a much greater capacity to impact the brain, including in the treatment of stroke. •  Aphasia: If the patient is having trouble speaking, you may also cross the Motor and Sensory Lines at the level of the tongue; however, needling this area will be extraordinarily painful for the patient, so either downsize to Seirin “00”/0.12mm x 30mm needles or leave these points out. •  Bleeding 1010.07 All Pivot (Tung’s DU15-DU16) and/or the blood vessels underneath the tongue can also be useful for tongue paralysis. •  Duration of treatment: Treating a stroke patient can take a long time, not only because they move more slowly and laboriously, but also because there are so many components to the treatment. Be sure the patient is well hydrated and has excellent blood sugar before you begin. As is clear in the overall treatment protocol described above, it is important that you have assistance with physically moving the patient, especially because once the needles are placed and the patient is prone, someone else can take over moving the patient’s limbs for the next 30-40 minutes while you work with another patient. Additional bleeding treatment options: Most stroke patients are taking blood thinners; however, this does not mean their blood will not clot. If anything, it makes our bleeding techniques slightly more productive and therefore more effective. •  To clear the brain: Bleed 99.08 Ear Apex on the side opposite the hemiplegia (bleeding the same side where the stroke occurred within the brain). •  If the blood pressure is high: Bleed the Jing-Well points (I prefer bleeding the fingertips, being sure to hold them lower than the heart and “milking” the fingers); bleed 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) and UB40 Wei Zhong; or bleed DT.04 Five Mountain Range. Bleeding veins found on the Stomach or Gallbladder channels also reduces blood pressure. •  For phlegm accumulation: Bleed 77.14 Four Flower Outer (ST40/phlegm gathering point) to dissolve phlegm, move blood and clear stagnation. •  Bamboo cupping: Bamboo cupping is a bleeding technique that utilizes small three- to four-inch sections of bamboo, which are boiled and placed over small puncture sites. (Please see Bamboo Cupping on my DVD set, The Ancient Art of Cupping.) It is particularly effective for nerve damage or prolonged paralysis resulting in extreme blood stagnation. I used to watch Dr. Lee bamboo-cup stroke patients all the way down the Large Intestine channel on the arm and the Gallbladder channel on the leg. This treatment is especially helpful in a chronic case, when the patient has been immobile for more than six months. With any kind of bleeding treatment, be sure the patient has good blood sugar and is well rested before and after the procedure. In the right situation, bamboo cupping is invaluable. Of note, bamboo cupping is also my primary treatment for ankylosing spondylitis (see 77.01-77.02 Correct Tendons for further information). Additional needling options (in no particular order): Acute stroke that has just occurred: Needle 22.01-22.02 Double Child/ Double Fairy on the side opposite the brain bleed; needle or bleed 33.16 Curve Mound (LU5) on the same side, to sedate. •  Brain circulation: Needle 77.05-77.07 Three Weights to increase circulation to the brain. Needling on the same side as the brain bleed treats the affected arm. However, bleeding on the same side (dark veins found in the area of Three Weights) helps to clear blood stagnation in the brain. I may choose to needle Three Weights bilaterally to treat the whole brain and the arm, but you will need to decide for yourself what is best for your patient. •  Late-stage treatment: In addition to using the standard protocol, also bilaterally needle 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors to tonify the Kidneys. With long-term paralysis, avoid the use of too many needles. Bleeding techniques are a great alternative in cases of long-term blood stagnation. Formulas: Dr. Young taught me to modify Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang for stroke. This formula is used for early-stage stroke, to move the qi and vitalize the blood. If constipation is an issue, add Rou Cong Rong (cistanche) and Suo Yang (cynomorium). If the blood pressure is not high, gradually increase the Huang Qi up to 50 grams. If there is hypertension, add Sang Ji Sheng and fried Du Zhong. Also, Di Huang Yin Zi is used to tonify Kidney yin and yang, astringe essence and open the orifices. Herbs such as Du Zhong and Huai Niu Xi can be added to subsequent formulas to tonify the Liver and Kidneys. I also like Hua Tou Zai Zao Wan for cerebral vascular issues or coronary heart disease. It is very effective in treating angina, but it does not prolong clotting time, so it is okay to take with blood thinners (which are typically prescribed). I also recommend high doses of emulsified turmeric, CoQ10 or PQQ, and Omega 3 in the form of krill oil, not fish oil (krill is lower on the food chain, so it carries less mercury). Liu Wei Di Huang (Six Ingredients) tonifies the Kidneys (as long as the patient can digest it; do not use if the patient has Spleen dampness/teeth marks). In acute stroke, if the patient has a feeding tube, you can use it to administer herbs directly into the stomach. •  Dietary recommendations: Because stroke patients are not moving, it is imperative that their nutrition is good. Calories must be spent on healthy fats and proteins, while sugars and simple carbohydrates must be avoided as much as possible. Do not pamper disabled patients with treats like alcohol, caffeine or sugar, because these would hamper their recovery. Fresh fruits and vegetables and non-processed foods are always best. Patients should not overeat, as extra weight would make it harder for them to move. •  Insomnia: Chronic insomnia (over five years) can lead to blood stagnation and the breakdown of communication between the Heart and Kidney. The treatment principle is to tonify Kidney yin, sedate Liver fire, dissolve phlegm, vitalize blood, and re-establish the Heart and Kidney connection. Trouble falling asleep is due to blood deficiency or Liver qi stagnation; trouble staying asleep is due to Liver and Kidney yin deficiency creating Liver yang rising. Patients who frequently awaken between 1:00–3:00 a.m. have Liver qi congestion; those who are awake for hours have Liver-related insomnia. If a patient is asleep and suddenly wakes up, it is due to empty Gallbladder. To address tossing and turning, restless or uncomfortable sleep, we can use the special relationship between the Hand Jue Yin and Foot Yang Ming (PC/ST) to tonify the Heart and calm the spirit. Dr. Young considers Center Nine Miles (GB31) the best point for Liver/Kidney-deficient insomnia, as well as insomnia due to Heart yang deficiency, for all of the above reasons and also due to the special relationship between the Hand Shao Yin (HT) and Foot Shao Yang (GB). Treatment options for insomnia: •  Needle 1010.08 Tranquility (Yin Tang); bilaterally needle Jian Gu (Extra Point), 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors (excellent for insomnia caused by Kidney yin deficiency) and 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31). •  Jian Gu (Extra Point): I learned Jian Gu from Dr. Young and have found it very useful. It is located by palpating the second metacarpal bone between 22.04 Da Bai (Great White) and 22.05 Ling Gu (Spirit Bone) to find the most sensitive point. I use a 0.15 x 16mm needle or a Koryo Hand Therapy needle pellet aligned with the metacarpal bone. As long as it does not get wet, a needle pellet can be retained overnight and removed by the patient the following day. •  Because of LV3 Tai Chong, the classic Four Gates combination (LI4/LV3) has a digestive function related to the earth element. When treating anxiety-type insomnia, we can use Anxiety Four Gates, a point combination of LI3 with LV2, for an effect more related to Ying-Spring fire. This combination was taught to me by Dr. Young to treat insomnia due to Liver and Kidney deficiency. To Anxiety Four Gates, 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors and 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) may be added. Additional insomnia options: •  Bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex for acute sleep issues due to Liver qi stagnation causing fire (Liver yang rising). These points can be bled safely once every four to five days. •  Needle the Prefrontal Scalp Points. •  Needle left-side 11.17 Wood (Anger). •  Needle 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20), especially with 1010.08 Tranquility. •  To treat insomnia with dreamful sleep, bilaterally needle HT7 Shen Men with GB44 Qiao Yin (Dr. Young). •  Insomnia formulas/dietary advice: Huang Lian, E Jiao, Egg Yolk Tang is a good formula for sleep. Drinking milk with egg yolk (no whites) is tranquilizing. Golden needles (dried day lily buds) are eaten for insomnia, and also to alleviate cough. Basic treatment principles for insomnia are to soothe the Liver fire, dissolve phlegm, vitalize blood and restore communication between Heart and Kidneys. Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan is used for deficiency of blood and vital essence of the Heart and Kidneys. For chronic insomnia, vitalize blood to dissolve stagnation with Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang, or by combining Si Ni San with Tao Hong Si Wu Tang. People who have irritability from severe Liver qi stagnation, and who wake up between 1:00–3:00 a.m. (frequently extending to 3:30 a.m.), always respond best to a modified Xiao Yao Wan taken in high doses before bed. •  Response to trauma (Dr. Lee): “If a patient has had a traumatic injury such as falling from a ladder, treatment may alleviate the physical pain. But, in cases of PTSD the patient continues to suffer nightmares and other psychological disturbances, even though the physical trauma has healed. In these cases, use Center Nine Miles (GB31) or GB34 Yang Ling Quan to relieve the fear and trembling due to ‘empty’ Gallbladder” (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Itching and wind: In Chapter 74 of the Su Wen, it says, “All pain, itching and skin disorders arise from the Heart.” Because we understand that the perception of pain comes from the spirit, and in Chinese medicine the spirit is said to be stored in the Heart, we also recognize the special relationship between the Foot Shao Yang (GB) and Hand Shao Yin (HT) in relation to pain and itching. Does itching cause shen disturbance, or does shen disturbance, with the movement of wind, cause itching? This is like asking, “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” Center Nine Miles, with its extraordinary capacity to expel wind and calm the spirit, is highly effective in treating all kinds of itching. I usually choose 88.17-88.19 Four Horses for itching because of the points’ proximity to GB31. If the itching is related to sinus conditions or an allergic response, Four Horses are utilizing not only the Gallbladder channel’s ability to dispel wind, but also their connection to the Lung (skin) and the Liver (blood). In extreme cases, we can combine GB31 with Four Horses and A.04 San Cha Three. See 88.17-88.19 Four Horses for further information. •  Migraines: Center Nine Miles (GB31) was one of Master Tung’s most commonly selected points. It treats whole-head headaches and migraines because it opens the Spleen, Liver, Kidney and all three Jiao, disperses wind, tranquilizes and relieves pain. Generally speaking, migraine headaches can be considered reoccurring severe headaches that are frequently accompanied by vomiting, light sensitivity, visual changes and extreme pain. Each person’s migraines involve different kinds of triggers: food allergies, hormones, chemical sensitivities, stress levels and sleep deprivation; but in my opinion, unexpressed anger is always a common denominator. Based on more than thirty years of experience, I offer the following advice for treating migraine headaches: •  Chronic migraines often include muscle spasms in the neck and shoulders that can result in the buildup of toxins. I may not cup a migraine patient during their initial visit, because I know the cups will be painful and I would prefer that the patient feel comfortable with me as a practitioner before I initiate such intense therapy. However, targeted and thorough cupping is definitely a part of my overall migraine treatment, and I prioritize it. Cupping the toxin areas, as well as the Shao Yang and Tai Yang areas of the neck, shoulders and upper back, is included. Sometimes cupping alone can resolve the worst type of headache, because when the muscles of the neck and shoulders are in spasm or full of toxin buildup, circulation to the head is blocked. Cupping pulls toxins out of the blood and draws freshly oxygenated blood into the head. If the patient also has severe TMJ, it is helpful to schedule a good time for face cupping. See 66.04 Fire Master for information about cupping the jaw for TMJ. Migraine treatment options: •  Center Nine Miles (GB31), needled on the opposite side or bilaterally, treats most points on the head and eliminates internal wind; it is particularly effective in treating temporal or parietal migraines. •  77.22-77.23 Beside Three Miles (Tung’s GB34), are needled on the opposite side for Liver/Gallbladder headache related to tendons and ligaments, usually accompanied by neck and shoulder pain. •  22.04-22.05 Ling Gu/Da Bai and Center Nine Miles (GB31) are effective for whole-head headache or headache on both sides. Tai Yang (Extra Point) bleeding is important in the treatment of chronic migraines, because it removes toxins and stagnation, clears the eyes, lowers blood pressure, calms the spirit and opens the mind. Be sure to find the artery in the temple area and avoid it. There are many uses for bleeding in this area. •  For nausea and vomiting due to migraine, bleed 1010.07 All Pivot to drop the stomach and stop vomiting. •  Bleeding 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex clears wind heat from the head. •  66.05 Golden Gate (Tung’s ST43), needled unilaterally, is particularly helpful for Yang Ming channel migraines, especially frontal and temple types. If the headache is premenstrual, Golden Gate relieves the pain and quiets the womb (for cramping). •  66.12 Fire Scatter (KD2) may be needled (usually unilaterally) to treat migraines due to hypertension, because it harmonizes water and fire. This point is forbidden in pregnancy. •  Case history, leg and hip pain (Dr. Lee): “A 70-year-old woman arrived with leg and hip pain that was so severe she was in tears. She could not say exactly where the pain was since it seemed to move around. I treated 88.25-88.27 Three Nine Miles on the opposite side while she moved the affected leg. After the first treatment, the woman stopped crying and smiled. After three treatments her pain was eliminated entirely. This kind of moveable pain is caused by Gallbladder wind. If the patient suffers from this condition and you palpate opposite side 88.25 Center Nine Miles (GB31) the patient will jump with pain” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",

Dizziness: 88.28 Release resolves dizziness after needling due to low blood sugar, fatigue, overeating, or excessive exercise. Have the patient lie down with their feet elevated, then needle this point. My patients are well trained to know that they should arrive for treatment with good blood sugar; however, I keep protein bars on hand for those requiring a boost in blood sugar. I always ask patients if they have eaten recently, especially before cupping, bleeding or strong needling. Emergency point (Dr. Lee): “This point can be used if one mistakenly pierces a blood vessel during acupuncture and there is pain and swelling. Also one may use this point for the treatment of traumatic injury where the patient is upset and cannot calm down. It will help stop the pain and calm the spirit. Another treatment for fear, shaking, pallor, cold sweats, and even apnea due to acupuncture is to needle 22.10 Hand Release (HT8 Shao Fu). One should also raise the patient’s legs, put a cold towel on their forehead, and stay calm, the practitioner should not become excited. One can also moxa ST36 Zu San Li which will move blood to the head. If the needle shock is very severe one can press the root of the tongue with a spoon in order to induce vomiting, because this causes the Stomach qi to raise upward and will also raise the qi back to the Heart. I do not use this point in emergency often, since points on the hands are more easily needled” (Dr. Lee, 1992). Emergency point (Dr. Young): “If the patient faints during acupuncture treatment force him to open the mouth and press the tongue root with a flat needle, spoon or finger a few times. When the patient is going to vomit wash his head with cold water or cover his head with a cold wet towel then give him a glass of cold water to bring him around. Shock due to torture can be alleviated with the same approach” (Dr. Young, 2008). ",

I most frequently use these points for schoolteachers when laryngitis or bronchitis causes them to lose their voice. These points have a function similar to SP5 Shang Qiu. The Spleen, Liver and Kidney meridians all pass through the throat; the Spleen and Kidney connect to the root of the tongue. I have found that for the throat, a more powerful treatment is to bleed 1010.07 All Pivot (DU15-DU16 area) or VT.01 Nine Moths. Of course, bleeding LU11 and LI1 is always effective for sore throat. Commentary (Dr. Lee): “Some of Master Tung’s students say that there are three points here, not two. I have not found these points effective for loss of voice” (Dr. Lee, 1992). ",

Look for a good vessel on the back of the ear; if one is found, bleed it. If there is not a good vessel at Ear Back, bleed the tip of the ear instead. •  When bleeding ear points: Look for an obvious vessel, especially at the apex, as you will usually find one and it will bleed sufficiently. Insert a lancet or triangular needle obliquely to avoid damaging the cartilage. Thicker ears bleed easily; thinner ears must be squeezed. Bleeding even just a few drops of blood can be very effective. On occasion, I have had to stop the bleeding intentionally, because the ear can tend to bleed freely, especially with high blood pressure or excess conditions of the head. Before a bleeding treatment, warm the patient’s ears with your hands; if they are cold, they will not bleed as well as when they are warm. •  Ear Back: When bleeding this point, any blood vessel on the upper third of the ear is a good choice. ",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: Bleeding Ear Back or Ear Apex tonifies the Heart, which controls the shen, and it tonifies the Kidney, which controls the brain. Bleeding either point clears Liver fire, calms the spirit, disperses wind, vitalizes the blood and relieves stagnation. •  Chronic or acute: Chronic diseases affect the Heart and Kidney; acute diseases are related to the Liver. These points address both chronic and acute conditions. •  Mental and structural issues: The Urinary Bladder channel goes to the ears via 1010.01 Upright Meeting (DU20). Therefore, the ears can be chosen to address head issues, both mental and structural, as well as Urinary Bladder channel problems, including spine and back pain. •  Connection to the Gallbladder (wind) and skin: The Urinary Bladder and Gallbladder channels meet at the back of the ear. Because the Urinary Bladder channel dominates the exterior, these points are good for treating skin diseases. Because the Gallbladder channel is primary in dispersing wind, these ear points can treat all kinds of wind diseases. The combination of these two influences makes these ear points some of Master Tung’s favorites, and they are exceptionally useful in treating both wind in the head (hypertension, headache and facial paralysis) and skin diseases. I always add 88.17-88.19 Four Horses when treating the skin. •  Connecting Heart and Kidney: The Heart meridian opens to the tongue internally and the ear externally. Because the Heart controls the spirit and the ear is the opening to both the Heart and the Kidney, when Heart and Kidney are not communicating there may be palpitations, insomnia, sweating and anxiety. Ear Back and Ear Apex restore proper communication by calming the spirit, dispersing wind and clearing heat. Night sweats: Because the Heart controls sweating, Ear Back or Ear Apex can be bled for night sweats. For menopausal women, include 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors and LV3 and LI4 Four Gates. •  Case history (diabetic kitty): A former office manager in my clinic relocated to the east coast. She called me in distress because her aging diabetic cat was failing due to blood sugar that could not be controlled. She asked me if there were any treatments she might be able to do herself. Bleeding Ear Back was the only treatment I could imagine being highly effective and relatively easy to do. Because the animal’s ears were almost translucent, it was easy for her to find a vessel to puncture with a lancet. She bled her cat’s ears every other day, and his blood sugar normalized within the week. He obviously felt better, though she was required to bleed him weekly in order for his insulin to work. •  Low back pain (Dr. Young): “To treat low back pain, bleed 99.07 Ear Back or 99.08 Ear Apex. The best time to bleed is between 1pm-5pm in the afternoon, because at that time qi and blood circulate in the Hand Tai Yang (SI) and Foot Tai Yang (UB) meridians” (Dr. Young, 2008).",

She did not use ear seeds because they were not available at the time, although press tacks were. Neither of us liked the non-sterile approach of retaining press tacks. The following are general combinations that include points not found in Tung’s acupuncture: •  Stop smoking: •  Weight loss: Apply needles or ear seeds unilaterally to: Heart/Thyroid, Inner Secretion, Hunger Point, Kidney, Sympathetic and Shen Men (Dr. Lee, 1992). •  Classic TCM textbooks have good ear charts to reference; however, auricular therapy has evolved over time.

DT.01-DT.02 may be needled, bled or seven-star hammered. Depth: 1.0-1.5 cun (Note: I have never needled these points and I discourage it.)",
        "comments": "Cupping the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas: Also known as the Poison Points, these are in an area on the lateral edge of the shoulder blades, where the liver stashes toxins that it cannot fully eliminate from the body. Cupping the Toxin Areas is very effective in clearing accumulated waste or poisons (environmental, pharmaceutical, etc.). I usually cup the Toxin Areas on every patient until their skin stops coloring; on a healthy person, this would be accomplished in two cupping sessions. The first time a patient is cupped, their cup marks are usually much darker and the treatment is far more uncomfortable than in subsequent cupping sessions. Eighty percent of the toxins that have accumulated are usually removed during the first cupping treatment and also within the first minute, making this time the most painful. The second cupping treatment, done at least ten days later, should remove the residual 20% of toxins, which are usually found in the gaps between the previously applied cups. If this is the case, the third treatment, a few months later, verifies that toxins are not continuing to accumulate. If the area continues to color in the second cupping treatment much as it did in the first session, this is a sign that the toxin buildup is severe. Continue to cup until the color stops appearing. If, by the fifth round of cupping, the cupped areas are still dark after cupping, this indicates that the patient is likely being exposed to toxins via their environment or is consuming too much animal protein. In my experience, when a patient removes all animal protein from their diet for a few weeks, the color becomes lighter and lighter. Once their skin has stopped coloring completely, animal protein may be reintroduced in significantly reduced amounts. In more than thirty years of practice, I have only seen dark cupping color reoccur three times. Patients should not need to have their 505 Back and Chest Points Toxin Areas cupped frequently. All of the patients in my practice are kept clean with quarterly or at least bi-annual cupping. I rarely need to seven-star hammer. Seven-star hammering: A picture tells a thousand words, so before you consider seven-star hammering a patient, I highly recommend that you watch the segments on seven-star hammering and sterile waste disposal in my online bleeding class (Please see Additional Learning Tools). When to seven-star hammer: Seven-star hammering followed by cupping of the Toxin Areas is a beautiful treatment, but it is rarely done. This technique is excruciatingly painful, but afterwards, people report enormous relief from severe itching – for example, from shingles, severe poison oak or poison ivy. These are the only reasons I would consider seven-star hammering the Toxin Areas. Shingles or herpes: It is a horrific experience to have shingles. If a patient suffers a severe case, they will never have shingles again and do not need to be vaccinated against it. I am cautious in recommending any vaccine, as most of them contain aluminum, a known neurotoxin. When seven-star hammering for shingles, never hammer and cup an area with blisters, as this would spread the virus. For shingles outbreaks anywhere on the body, the Toxin Areas may be hammered and cupped, and also the local area may be seven-star hammered. Remember to wait until the scabs fall off to hammer the new, fresh, pink skin beneath, while it is still visible. Though local hammering is even more painful than hammering the Toxin Areas, it allows the toxins that are lodged in the nerve endings a way to escape, thus preventing postherpetic neuralgia, a gruesome aftermath of shingles. The same treatment is also a fantastic way to end repetitive herpes outbreaks. Though the herpes virus is still likely to reside in the spinal cord, it will no longer live in the habituated distal areas. Remember, never hammer a herpes blister; wait for the scab to fall off, as you will then see pink skin indicating the proper location. Whether this treatment is for shingles or herpes, there are places where cups cannot be applied (such as within the hairline or eyebrow). For these, simply seven-star hammer and then swipe with a sterile gauze pad. The patient should feel immediate relief with the first swipe. When hammering and swiping, always wear gloves and do not make skin contact with the “dirty” blood. Blood products must be disposed of properly; flush them down the toilet or place them in a doubled Sharps bag. Never seven-star hammer the genitals. Note: When students are learning about detoxification through cupping and seven-star hammering, they tend to get overexcited before they have personally experienced these treatments. I never use a treatment on another person unless I have experienced it. Be sensitive to your patient, as simply cupping the Toxin Area is highly effective 99.9% of the time. Even when you know toxins exist, seven- star hammering is excessive. Simple cupping is enough to handle toxicity from environmental sources, pharmaceuticals, food poisoning, or allergic responses, as well as conditions as common as eczema, psoriasis, and rashes. When, and only when, there is severe itching, I seven-star hammer and then cup the Toxin Area. Additional Toxin Areas: In the course of cupping thousands of patients and seeing interesting similarities, I have identified additional Toxin Areas that may be cupped. When the Toxin Areas on the outside of the scapula are cupped, this effectively gives the liver a larger storage area in which to deposit that which otherwise overwhelms it. Areas of pain or discomfort often harbor waste or toxins that the body is unable to eliminate on its own. Toxins also accumulate in places that are not particularly painful, but the skin colors darkly when cupped. I define these places as additional toxin areas, and I suspect that they overlap with the lymphatic system. So far, I have discovered three areas, in addition to DT.01-DT.02, that frequently color in this way. These areas are described below. Note: To avoid injury in these sensitive areas, be sure to use a cup no larger than the #4 (1.3 cun). Behind the earlobes: Directly behind the earlobes (as close as a cup can be placed without cupping the actual flesh of the earlobe) is another Toxin Area where almost every person’s skin turns black when it is cupped. This area is often very dark on the front half, which is why the cup needs to be directly behind the lobe to remove as much accumulated toxicity as possible – and therefore to get the skin to color as much as possible. It is very useful to cup here until color no longer appears, when treating any kind of Shao Yang neck pain, TMJ, headaches, ear infections, vertigo or tinnitus. Because the skin is dark after cupping on every person I have ever cupped for the first time, it is also part of my standard practice in long-term care. As an aside, to definitively diagnose an ear infection, the practitioner may palpate directly behind the earlobe. When an infection is brewing, this area is very sore, as is the depression just in front of the opening to the ear. If it is sore upon palpation, cup behind the ear carefully and gently, always using a small cup. Do not cup if it is excruciating, as this indicates that the eardrum is ready to burst. Cupping will not burst the eardrum, but at this advanced stage of an ear infection, the procedure would be far too painful. Where the neck and top of the shoulders come together on the sides: When cupping a patient’s neck, it is necessary to shave or oil the fine hair on the back of the neck. I usually begin cupping on the back of the neck, as close to the occiput as I can get. Then, I proceed downward toward DU14 and continue around the sides of the neck to find another Toxin Area located where the neck and top of the shoulder come together. When #4 cups are placed on these toxin points, they stand at a 45-degree angle away from the body. This indicates that the placement is correct. Because these cups are half on the neck and half on the shoulder, toxins are being pulled from the base of the neck, where cervical and thoracic vertebrae unite, tension is held, and toxins accumulate. Frequently, the skin color from cupping this Shao Yang area is even darker than the color found on the Tai Yang where the neck joins the back. Because of the finer muscles, tendons and nerves in this area, please be sure to honor the recommendation to use a smaller sized cup, even on a larger neck. Where the sacrum and coccyx meet: This Toxin Area would be likely to color on most people, but I do not routinely cup it, not only because it is inconvenient but also because the area is somewhat private. However, if I am cupping other points in the vicinity, I am sure to catch this one too, even if the patient is not complaining of coccyx pain. I always inform the patient before palpating or cupping a personal area such as this one. It is necessary to stretch the cheeks of the buttocks at the top of the crease in order to keep a small cup from popping off. If you see a tiny line of blood underneath this cup, there is yeast in the crease that may be treated topically with a cream, such as Monistat. Strengthen immunity: Due to the Reaction Area of the Endocrine Glands, the Toxin Points assist in regulating the endocrine system. They are very effective in draining 507 Back and Chest Points toxins located anywhere in the body, in part because of their proximity to the Small Intestine channel, which drains damp heat. When the skin continues to color from cupping, I frequently extend the Toxin Area and follow the color under the armpit; however, I usually don’t do this in the first cupping session, as the area tends to be painful when cupped, and the skin tends to color darkly. When people are very ill and their entire system is compromised, toxins also accumulate in the area of the rib cage just under the armpit, perhaps influencing or influenced by other pathways such as the Spleen, Heart, Liver and Gallbladder. When this entire area is cleaned through cupping, toxins are dumped into the bloodstream quickly, so the patient needs to rest and drink lots of water to assist in their removal. Be sure to instruct the patient to rest and eat well after a cupping treatment that yields dark skin color. Hardy patients can endure an all-in-one cupping treatment, while extremely fragile patients may prefer multiple cupping sessions to a very thorough one. Within 48 hours, all patients should expect to feel far better than they did before the cupping. Immediately, however, they may be a little tired while their circulatory system eliminates the toxins that were pulled from structural tissues and deeper organs outward to the surface of the skin. Cupping the Toxin Areas strengthens the immune system, boosts circulation and frees all bodily processes of elimination. The liver loves to have the Toxin Areas cupped. Breast inflammation: Please note that the lower Toxin Point also has the Reaction Area of the Breast, making the cupping of this area a good choice when female patients have premenstrual breast pain. Cancer treatment detoxification: Of course, I cup the Toxin Areas when detoxing a patient from chemotherapy or radiation (waiting until they have a break from those treatments), whether they are being treated for breast cancer or any other type. Case history (poison oak): For the first few weeks of this patient’s treatment, I really did not know what he looked like, because he came to me with the most severe case of poison oak I have ever seen. Someone had burned slash in his mountain neighborhood and inadvertently exposed everyone within distance of the smoke to systemic cases of poison oak, via inhalation. This poor man looked like a monster and could not see from either of his eyes. His sinus, nose and lips were so swollen that he could barely breathe through them. Because he had inhaled poison oak into his lungs, it had spread to his bloodstream and throughout his entire body. When he came to me for treatment, he had already received several cortisone injections and was taking prednisone. Because seven-star hammering and cupping of his Toxin Areas immediately and significantly relieved the itching that had him on the brink of suicide, he became my patient for life. Case history (shingles): A woman in her mid-thirties came to me with a patch of shingles on the back of her neck. To immediately stop the burning and itching, I applied a combination of toxic topical herbs mixed with sesame oil to the lesion, and gave her some of the mixture to reapply at home. Weeks later, when the scabs had fallen off, I lightly seven-star hammered the area to complete the treatment. Interestingly, this episode of shingles was the first indication of a compromised immune system. A healthy thirty-year old is unlikely to contract shingles; usually, shingles only occurs in the elderly, weak or compromised. Twenty years later, I cupped her Toxin Areas and bled the site of the original shingles outbreak (1010.07 All Pivot) for nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. Her treatment for breast cancer was effective and she returned to her life as a teacher and mother.",

These points are usually cupped: Though the points are usually cupped until clear margins are noticed, the Toxin Area may extend beyond DT.01-DT.02, to the rib cage beneath the armpit, as well as medially toward the spine. DT.01-DT.02 may be needled, bled or seven-star hammered. Depth: 1.0-1.5 cun (Note: I have never needled these points and I discourage it.)",
        "comments": "Cupping the DT.01-DT.02 Toxin Areas: Also known as the Poison Points, these are in an area on the lateral edge of the shoulder blades, where the liver stashes toxins that it cannot fully eliminate from the body. Cupping the Toxin Areas is very effective in clearing accumulated waste or poisons (environmental, pharmaceutical, etc.). I usually cup the Toxin Areas on every patient until their skin stops coloring; on a healthy person, this would be accomplished in two cupping sessions. The first time a patient is cupped, their cup marks are usually much darker and the treatment is far more uncomfortable than in subsequent cupping sessions. Eighty percent of the toxins that have accumulated are usually removed during the first cupping treatment and also within the first minute, making this time the most painful. The second cupping treatment, done at least ten days later, should remove the residual 20% of toxins, which are usually found in the gaps between the previously applied cups. If this is the case, the third treatment, a few months later, verifies that toxins are not continuing to accumulate. If the area continues to color in the second cupping treatment much as it did in the first session, this is a sign that the toxin buildup is severe. Continue to cup until the color stops appearing. If, by the fifth round of cupping, the cupped areas are still dark after cupping, this indicates that the patient is likely being exposed to toxins via their environment or is consuming too much animal protein. In my experience, when a patient removes all animal protein from their diet for a few weeks, the color becomes lighter and lighter. Once their skin has stopped coloring completely, animal protein may be reintroduced in significantly reduced amounts. In more than thirty years of practice, I have only seen dark cupping color reoccur three times. Patients should not need to have their 505 Back and Chest Points Toxin Areas cupped frequently. All of the patients in my practice are kept clean with quarterly or at least bi-annual cupping. I rarely need to seven-star hammer. Seven-star hammering: A picture tells a thousand words, so before you consider seven-star hammering a patient, I highly recommend that you watch the segments on seven-star hammering and sterile waste disposal in my online bleeding class (Please see Additional Learning Tools). When to seven-star hammer: Seven-star hammering followed by cupping of the Toxin Areas is a beautiful treatment, but it is rarely done. This technique is excruciatingly painful, but afterwards, people report enormous relief from severe itching – for example, from shingles, severe poison oak or poison ivy. These are the only reasons I would consider seven-star hammering the Toxin Areas. Shingles or herpes: It is a horrific experience to have shingles. If a patient suffers a severe case, they will never have shingles again and do not need to be vaccinated against it. I am cautious in recommending any vaccine, as most of them contain aluminum, a known neurotoxin. When seven-star hammering for shingles, never hammer and cup an area with blisters, as this would spread the virus. For shingles outbreaks anywhere on the body, the Toxin Areas may be hammered and cupped, and also the local area may be seven-star hammered. Remember to wait until the scabs fall off to hammer the new, fresh, pink skin beneath, while it is still visible. Though local hammering is even more painful than hammering the Toxin Areas, it allows the toxins that are lodged in the nerve endings a way to escape, thus preventing postherpetic neuralgia, a gruesome aftermath of shingles. The same treatment is also a fantastic way to end repetitive herpes outbreaks. Though the herpes virus is still likely to reside in the spinal cord, it will no longer live in the habituated distal areas. Remember, never hammer a herpes blister; wait for the scab to fall off, as you will then see pink skin indicating the proper location. Whether this treatment is for shingles or herpes, there are places where cups cannot be applied (such as within the hairline or eyebrow). For these, simply seven-star hammer and then swipe with a sterile gauze pad. The patient should feel immediate relief with the first swipe. When hammering and swiping, always wear gloves and do not make skin contact with the “dirty” blood. Blood products must be disposed of properly; flush them down the toilet or place them in a doubled Sharps bag. Never seven-star hammer the genitals. Note: When students are learning about detoxification through cupping and seven-star hammering, they tend to get overexcited before they have personally experienced these treatments. I never use a treatment on another person unless I have experienced it. Be sensitive to your patient, as simply cupping the Toxin Area is highly effective 99.9% of the time. Even when you know toxins exist, seven- star hammering is excessive. Simple cupping is enough to handle toxicity from environmental sources, pharmaceuticals, food poisoning, or allergic responses, as well as conditions as common as eczema, psoriasis, and rashes. When, and only when, there is severe itching, I seven-star hammer and then cup the Toxin Area. Additional Toxin Areas: In the course of cupping thousands of patients and seeing interesting similarities, I have identified additional Toxin Areas that may be cupped. When the Toxin Areas on the outside of the scapula are cupped, this effectively gives the liver a larger storage area in which to deposit that which otherwise overwhelms it. Areas of pain or discomfort often harbor waste or toxins that the body is unable to eliminate on its own. Toxins also accumulate in places that are not particularly painful, but the skin colors darkly when cupped. I define these places as additional toxin areas, and I suspect that they overlap with the lymphatic system. So far, I have discovered three areas, in addition to DT.01-DT.02, that frequently color in this way. These areas are described below. Note: To avoid injury in these sensitive areas, be sure to use a cup no larger than the #4 (1.3 cun). Behind the earlobes: Directly behind the earlobes (as close as a cup can be placed without cupping the actual flesh of the earlobe) is another Toxin Area where almost every person’s skin turns black when it is cupped. This area is often very dark on the front half, which is why the cup needs to be directly behind the lobe to remove as much accumulated toxicity as possible – and therefore to get the skin to color as much as possible. It is very useful to cup here until color no longer appears, when treating any kind of Shao Yang neck pain, TMJ, headaches, ear infections, vertigo or tinnitus. Because the skin is dark after cupping on every person I have ever cupped for the first time, it is also part of my standard practice in long-term care. As an aside, to definitively diagnose an ear infection, the practitioner may palpate directly behind the earlobe. When an infection is brewing, this area is very sore, as is the depression just in front of the opening to the ear. If it is sore upon palpation, cup behind the ear carefully and gently, always using a small cup. Do not cup if it is excruciating, as this indicates that the eardrum is ready to burst. Cupping will not burst the eardrum, but at this advanced stage of an ear infection, the procedure would be far too painful. Where the neck and top of the shoulders come together on the sides: When cupping a patient’s neck, it is necessary to shave or oil the fine hair on the back of the neck. I usually begin cupping on the back of the neck, as close to the occiput as I can get. Then, I proceed downward toward DU14 and continue around the sides of the neck to find another Toxin Area located where the neck and top of the shoulder come together. When #4 cups are placed on these toxin points, they stand at a 45-degree angle away from the body. This indicates that the placement is correct. Because these cups are half on the neck and half on the shoulder, toxins are being pulled from the base of the neck, where cervical and thoracic vertebrae unite, tension is held, and toxins accumulate. Frequently, the skin color from cupping this Shao Yang area is even darker than the color found on the Tai Yang where the neck joins the back. Because of the finer muscles, tendons and nerves in this area, please be sure to honor the recommendation to use a smaller sized cup, even on a larger neck. Where the sacrum and coccyx meet: This Toxin Area would be likely to color on most people, but I do not routinely cup it, not only because it is inconvenient but also because the area is somewhat private. However, if I am cupping other points in the vicinity, I am sure to catch this one too, even if the patient is not complaining of coccyx pain. I always inform the patient before palpating or cupping a personal area such as this one. It is necessary to stretch the cheeks of the buttocks at the top of the crease in order to keep a small cup from popping off. If you see a tiny line of blood underneath this cup, there is yeast in the crease that may be treated topically with a cream, such as Monistat. Strengthen immunity: Due to the Reaction Area of the Endocrine Glands, the Toxin Points assist in regulating the endocrine system. They are very effective in draining 507 Back and Chest Points toxins located anywhere in the body, in part because of their proximity to the Small Intestine channel, which drains damp heat. When the skin continues to color from cupping, I frequently extend the Toxin Area and follow the color under the armpit; however, I usually don’t do this in the first cupping session, as the area tends to be painful when cupped, and the skin tends to color darkly. When people are very ill and their entire system is compromised, toxins also accumulate in the area of the rib cage just under the armpit, perhaps influencing or influenced by other pathways such as the Spleen, Heart, Liver and Gallbladder. When this entire area is cleaned through cupping, toxins are dumped into the bloodstream quickly, so the patient needs to rest and drink lots of water to assist in their removal. Be sure to instruct the patient to rest and eat well after a cupping treatment that yields dark skin color. Hardy patients can endure an all-in-one cupping treatment, while extremely fragile patients may prefer multiple cupping sessions to a very thorough one. Within 48 hours, all patients should expect to feel far better than they did before the cupping. Immediately, however, they may be a little tired while their circulatory system eliminates the toxins that were pulled from structural tissues and deeper organs outward to the surface of the skin. Cupping the Toxin Areas strengthens the immune system, boosts circulation and frees all bodily processes of elimination. The liver loves to have the Toxin Areas cupped. Breast inflammation: Please note that the lower Toxin Point also has the Reaction Area of the Breast, making the cupping of this area a good choice when female patients have premenstrual breast pain. Cancer treatment detoxification: Of course, I cup the Toxin Areas when detoxing a patient from chemotherapy or radiation (waiting until they have a break from those treatments), whether they are being treated for breast cancer or any other type.

When puncturing this many sites, if at all possible, have someone there to hold a tray of glass cups for you to choose from. Have your cups, lighter and cotton balls ready and waiting. Hold two small cotton balls with a hemostat, and soak them in denatured alcohol, thoroughly wringing them out to avoid dripping burning alcohol after they are lit. Palpate the spine to familiarize yourself with the upper back before beginning your bleeding technique. Use your thumbnail to press the points before puncturing them; this will result in less pain and better results. You may squeeze and swipe the beads of blood; however, cupping over as many punctures as possible is the most efficient way to draw the blood. With large cups, often more than one puncture site can be covered by one cup. It is not necessary to bleed all forty points, precisely. Though I may puncture close to 40 times, I do not count the punctures because that would be distracting.",
        "comments": "Emergency points for high fever or hypertension: I have used Five Mountain Range on multiple occasions when urgent treatment was required to open the DU Mai. In every case, a trip to the emergency room was avoided and I was afforded the time to treat the underlying condition. I use Five Mountain Range primarily to drop a very high fever that involves severe lung stagnation (such as pneumonia or pneumocystis), or to lower extremely high blood pressure (220/120). Alternative hypertension treatment: When treating extremely high blood pressure, consider also bleeding the fingertips as they will produce more blood and be less painful to bleed than the Jing-Well points. This is equally effective and easier to accomplish, though the ten fingertip punctures may be more painful than Five Mountain Range. Caution (high blood pressure): A patient whose blood pressure is nearing 220/120 should not be allowed to leave the clinic until blood pressure treatments bring it down to around 150/90, after which they should be directed to the nearest emergency room for medication. It is always wiser to wean patients with high blood pressure off their medications slowly than to risk any kind of cerebrovascular event. Be smart!",

Scarlet fever: The characteristic diagnostic trait of scarlet fever is a whole-body rash with unusual redness of the cheeks and a pale ring around the mouth. Scarlet fever typically occurs after exposure to the streptococcal bacteria, and a throat culture is required to accurately diagnose this strain of bacteria. Painful and enlarged tonsils, fatigue and fever are telltale of both strep throat and scarlet fever, though scarlet fever is followed by a characteristic rash beginning on the first or second day, usually fading by the third or fourth day. Other complications are rare but can be severe; without them, resolution is expected by the tenth day. Because DT.05 disperses heat and clears fire in the Lungs, bleeding these points hastens the disease process and reduces symptoms, though antibiotics are recommended.

This point does not bleed freely and must be cupped in order to draw at least a tablespoon of blood. If you bleed these points and the pain returns within twenty-four hours, it will not be effective to bleed them again; the knee degeneration is too advanced.",
        "comments": "Energetic pathways: I only bleed these points for knee pain, and only if one or more of the points (on the same side as the pain) are extremely sensitive to palpation. All three points are metal, hence the name Three Gold. They relate to the Shu points of the Lung, Pericardium and Heart. In Tung’s acupuncture, all points that strengthen the Heart also treat the knees. Bleeding Three Gold has a remarkable effect on the treatment of pain that is underneath the kneecap, inside the joint. If the patient cannot describe the pain that way, I do not use this treatment. I have not found it to be effective if the knee pain is medial, lateral, proximal or distal to the joint. It is not used for injuries such as ACL tears. However, for chronic pain inside the joint, Three Gold is unsurpassed. This is one of the reasons I have coined the term “Magic” in “Master 515 Back and Chest Points Tung’s Magic Points” – when bleeding DT.07 is successful, patients have been known to laugh and cry with the joy of a gentle deep knee bend. Bone spurs in the knee: If walking downstairs is more painful than walking upstairs, there is likely to be a bone spur in the joint. Knee spurs are more frequently medial than lateral. Three Gold affects only soft tissue inflammation. See 22.08 Wrist Prosperous One (SI3) for further information about bone spurs. Case history: A retired physical education teacher had experienced thirty years of knee pain. She was visiting from out of town when she came to my clinic for treatment. I bled DT.07 Three Gold, and ten minutes later she got off the table and did a deep knee bend, laughing as she rose, free of pain. The treatment lasted for ten years, after which she returned to see me. I bled Three Gold again and the pain was gone once again. Such is the miraculous effect of bleeding these points. Case history: A fifty-year-old patient came for treatment of hot flashes and night sweats. In the course of her intake, I discovered that she had pain inside her knee joints. I bled the most sensitive of her Three Gold points, and the knee pain went away immediately. I then needled 11.06 Return to the Nest and 11.24 Gynecological Points with 77.18-77.21 Three Emperors, and gave her Liu Wei Di Huang to take home. One year later, she returned for treatment of her hot flashes, which were just beginning again. The knee pain had not yet returned. Three years later, when she noticed the knee pain again, I bled her Three Gold once more. I did not hear from this patient again for five years, at which time she called me; she’d had an X-ray, and an orthopedic surgeon had scheduled a knee replacement. I suggested that she come to see me for the tried and true bleeding of DT.07, after which she cancelled the knee replacement and returned to Thailand where she had relocated. It is not always a substitute for surgery, but in her case the treatment lasted for years at a time. This is typical of Three Gold and so I always try it, as long as I can palpate a telltale sensitive point. Case history (knee pain, Dr. Lee): “At a clinic in China I was introduced to an old man suffering from knee pain. He had suffered from knee pain for nine years whenever he stood up especially in the winter. He had been receiving standard TCM acupuncture for this problem for over nine years without much relief. In other words, he had been needled innumerable times at ST35 Xi Yan, ST36 Zu San Li, GB34 Yang Ling Quan, etc. Using Master Tung’s system I bled the area of UB43 Gao Huang Shu. After the treatment, the old man got up and said that this was the first time in nine years he had been able to stand without pain in his knees. The director of the clinic said sourly that they did not do such treatment in their clinic and dismissed the whole affair at that. Whether my treatment was right or wrong, however, should only be judged by the patient’s relief” (Dr. Lee, 1992).",
        "combinations": "Knee pain (degenerative): Bilaterally bleed DT.07 Three Gold, providing it is sensitive. Remember, bleeding is always done on the same side as the indications. To treat the most painful knee, after bleeding Three Gold, needle opposite-side PC6 Nei Guan, with same-side 66.03 Fire Hardness (Tung’s LV2) or 66.04 Fire Master (Tung’s LV3) as a Guiding Point. An alternative option is to add opposite-side ST36, SP9 and GB34 to the above points. Enlarged heart and heart disease: Bleed DT.07 Three Gold (Shu Points close to HT, PC, SI and LU). ",

Nowadays, we have antibiotics to treat these kinds of diseases and also one does not see much of this in the West.

Tonifying with moxa: My preferred treatment in this area is to moxa, especially during “moxa season.” Moxa season is a month-long period during which the Ming Men is said to be opening and closing. The two weeks in the middle of this time are when the gate is open wide, allowing the penetrating heat of moxa to tonify and build the pure qi more powerfully than at any other time. Moxa season occurs during every change of season; however, we focus only on the change from fall to winter (November 1-28), and winter to spring (starting the week prior to Lunar New Year). During the middle of moxa season, when the gate is open wide, a wind-cold invasion is particularly destructive, making it difficult for the patient to recover, perhaps for the entire year. During moxa season, daily application of moxa for 30 minutes over the kidneys, and then another 30 minutes between the navel and pubic bone, ensures good health and longevity. ",
